	abstract = {Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning complex patterns and concepts from training data. However, recent findings indicate that these models tend to rely heavily on simple and easily discernible features present in the background of images rather than the main concepts or objects they are intended to classify. This phenomenon poses a challenge to image classifiers as the crucial elements of interest in images may be overshadowed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this issue and improve the learning of main concepts by image classifiers. Our central idea revolves around concurrently guiding the model's attention toward the foreground during the classification task. By emphasizing the foreground, which encapsulates the primary objects of interest, we aim to shift the focus of the model away from the dominant influence of the background. To accomplish this, we introduce a mechanism that encourages the model to allocate sufficient attention to the foreground. We investigate various strategies, including modifying the loss function or incorporating additional architectural components, to enable the classifier to effectively capture the primary concept within an image. Additionally, we explore the impact of different foreground attention mechanisms on model performance and provide insights into their effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in improving the classification accuracy of image classifiers. Our findings highlight the importance of foreground attention in enhancing model understanding and representation of the main concepts within images. The results of this study contribute to advancing the field of image classification and provide valuable insights for developing more robust and accurate deep-learning models.},

	abstract = {Despite much research, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) still do not display the favorable scaling properties of other deep neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. Previous work has identified issues such as oversmoothing of the latent representation and have suggested solutions such as skip connections and sophisticated normalization schemes. Here, we propose a different approach that is based on a stratification of the graph nodes. We provide motivation that the nodes in a graph can be stratified into those with a low degree and those with a high degree and that the two groups are likely to behave differently. Based on this motivation, we modify the Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture so that the weight matrices are learned, separately, for the nodes in each group. This simple-to-implement modification seems to improve performance across datasets and GNN methods. To verify that this increase in performance is not only due to the added capacity, we also perform the same modification for random splits of the nodes, which does not lead to any improvement.},

	abstract = {Pairwise learning is essential in machine learning, especially for problems involving loss functions defined on pairs of training examples. Online gradient descent (OGD) algorithms have been proposed to handle online pairwise learning, where data arrives sequentially. However, the pairwise nature of the problem makes scalability challenging, as the gradient computation for a new sample involves all past samples. Recent advancements in OGD algorithms have aimed to reduce the complexity of calculating online gradients, achieving complexities less than $O(T)$ and even as low as $O(1)$. However, these approaches are primarily limited to linear models and have induced variance. In this study, we propose a limited memory OGD algorithm that extends to kernel online pairwise learning while improving the sublinear regret. Specifically, we establish a clear connection between the variance of online gradients and the regret, and construct online gradients using the most recent stratified samples with a limited buffer of size of $s$ representing all past data, which have a complexity of $O(sT)$ and employs $O(\sqrt{T}\log{T})$ random Fourier features for kernel approximation. Importantly, our theoretical results demonstrate that the variance-reduced online gradients lead to an improved sublinear regret bound. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over both kernelized and linear online pairwise learning algorithms.The code is available at https://github.com/halquabeh/ACML-2023-FPOGD-Code.git.},

	abstract = {Trees play a very important role in maintaining the ecosystem. To automate the process of extracting trees from Remote Sensing data and counting thereby, we have used Cartosat-2S merged products @ 0.6m as input. Vegetation indices such as NDVI, and EVI can retrieve the Vegetation class which contains trees and their look-alikes (such as grass, fields, and shrubs) having the same spectral signatures \em{i.e.}, high reflectance in NIR band, and high absorption in Red band. Extraction of only Trees is not possible with these indices. In this paper we present a novel method for tree delineation from its look-alikes using AIML, concentrating more on preparation of input datasets efficiently. Based on the Spectral Separability analysis, only Red and NIR bands from the satellite imagery are utilized in the proposed method to separate Vegetation from the background classes (such as water, bare soil, terrain, and built-up). In addition to the two bands from satellite imagery entropy layer is computed from the NIR band and utilized as the third band to delineate trees from their look-alikes. Deep Neural Networks have the capability of learning complex patterns that can separate trees and their look-alikes. However, the performance is boosted when the entropy layer is added to the input image. The proposed method showed better performance when utilizing 3 bands Red, NIR, and Entropy bands compared to 4 bands i.e. Red, Green, Blue, and NIR bands. The proposed method obtains a precision of 96\%, a recall of 90\%, and an F1-score of 93\% even with a relatively smaller training dataset. The study is performed on the data collected from various locations of the Indian state Rajasthan.},

	abstract = {The introduction of the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) algorithm has spurred the development of scalable imitation learning approaches using deep neural networks. Many of the algorithms that followed used a similar procedure, combining on-policy actor-critic algorithms with inverse reinforcement learning. More recently there have been an even larger breadth of approaches, most of which use off-policy algorithms. However, with the breadth of algorithms, everything from datasets to base reinforcement learning algorithms to evaluation settings can vary, making it difficult to fairly compare them. In this work we re-implement 6 different IL algorithms, updating 3 of them to be off-policy, base them on a common off-policy algorithm (SAC), and evaluate them on a widely-used expert trajectory dataset (D4RL) for the most common benchmark (MuJoCo). After giving all algorithms the same hyperparameter optimisation budget, we compare their results for a range of expert trajectories. In summary, GAIL, with all of its improvements, consistently performs well across a range of sample sizes, AdRIL is a simple contender that performs well with one important hyperparameter to tune, and behavioural cloning remains a strong baseline when data is more plentiful.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach, Equilibrium Point Learning (EPL), for training the deep equilibrium model (DEQ). In this method, the equilibrium point of the DEQ serves as the learnable parameters. Notably, the DEQ parameters encapsulate the learning algorithm itself and remain fixed. Consequently, by exploring the parameter space, we can discover a more efficient learning algorithm without relying on conventional techniques such as backpropagation or Q-learning. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary approach inspired by biological neurons to evolve the DEQ model parameters. Initially, we examine the physical dynamics of neurons at the molecular level and translate them into a dynamical system representation. Subsequently, we formulate a deep implicit layer that is mathematically proven to possess an equilibrium point. The energy function of the implicit layer is defined using a quadratic form augmented with entropy and momentum terms. Given the resemblance between the dynamics of the deep implicit layer and the principles of physics and chemistry, it can effectively capture the biomodel of systems biology and the neural model of spiking neural networks (SNNs). This equivalence enables us to define the implicit layer of the DEQ, allowing for seamless integration with existing artificial neural networks (ANNs). Finally, we employ HyperNEAT to evolve the parameters of the dynamical system. Through our experiments, we observe a consistent improvement in learning efficiency, with each successive generation exhibiting a 0.2\% increase in learning speed per generation.},

	abstract = {Our research demonstrates the significant benefits of using fine-tuning with explanations to enhance the performance of language models. Unlike prompting, which maintains the model's parameters, fine-tuning allows the model to learn and update its parameters during a training phase. In this study, we applied fine-tuning to various sized language models using data that contained explanations of the output rather than merely presenting the answers. We found that even smaller language models with as few as 60 million parameters benefited substantially from this approach. Interestingly, our results indicated that the detailed explanations were more beneficial to smaller models than larger ones, with the latter gaining nearly the same advantage from any form of explanation, irrespective of its length. Additionally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of explanations enables the models to solve tasks that they were not able to solve without explanations. Lastly, we argue that despite the challenging nature of adding explanations, samples that contain explanations not only reduce the volume of data required for training but also promote a more effective generalization by the model. In essence, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with explanations significantly bolsters the performance of large language models.},

However, the computational need for training diffusion models is considerably increased. In this work, we incorporate prototype learning into diffusion models to achieve high generation quality faster than the original diffusion model. Instead of randomly initialized class embeddings, we use separately learned class prototypes as the conditioning information to guide the diffusion process. We observe that our method, called ProtoDiffusion, achieves better performance in the early stages of training compared to the baseline method, signifying that using the learned prototypes shortens the training time. We demonstrate the performance of ProtoDiffusion using various datasets and experimental settings, achieving the best performance in shorter times across all settings.},

	abstract = {As a growing number of warehouse operators are moving from human-only to Collaborative human-robot Order Picking solutions, more efficient picker routing policies are needed, since the complexity of coordinating multiple actors in the system increases significantly. The objective of these policies is to match human pickers and robot carriers to fulfill picking tasks, optimizing pick-rate and total tardiness of the orders. In this paper, we propose to formulate the order picking routing problem as a more general combinatorial optimization problem known as Two-sided Online Bipartite Matching. We present an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to optimize a combination of pick-rate and order tardiness, and to deal with the uncertainty of real-world warehouse environments. To extract and exploit spatial information from the environment, we devise three different Graph Neural Network architectures and empirically evaluate them on several scenarios of growing complexity in a simulation environment we developed. We show that all proposed methods significantly outperform greedy and more sophisticated heuristics, as well as non-GNN-based DRL approaches. Moreover, our methods exhibit good transferability properties, even when scaling up test problem instances to more than forty times the size of the ones the models were trained on.

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance, but end-users do not understand how the system solves tasks due to the black-box nature of neural networks. Many methods from explainable machine learning have been adapted to RL. However, they do not focus on the unique challenges of explaining actions' short-term and long-term consequences. This work introduces a new perspective to understanding RL policies by clustering states into abstract states utilizing attention maps, giving a bird's-eye view of the policy's behavior. We learn the attention maps iteratively together with the clustering of states by masking the input features to estimate their importance. In contrast to previous works that have uninterpretable abstract states and/or clustering objectives using state values that are non-human intuitive, we only leverage attention maps in the clustering. The policy only indirectly affects the clustering via attention maps. This allows us to give global explanations from the view of feature attention, a quantity a human can relate to given interpretable features. The experiments demonstrate that our method provides faithful abstractions by capturing state semantics, policy behavior, and feature attention. Furthermore, we show that our attention maps can mask state features without affecting policy performance.},

@inproceedings{bhatt23,
	abstract = {Most existing federated learning methods are unable to estimate model/predictive uncertainty since the client models are trained using the standard loss function minimization approach which ignores such uncertainties. In many situations, however, especially in limited data settings, it is beneficial to take into account the uncertainty in the model parameters at each client as it leads to more accurate predictions and also because reliable estimates of uncertainty can be used for tasks, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and sequential decision-making tasks, such as active learning. We present a framework for federated learning with uncertainty where, in each round, each client infers the posterior distribution over its parameters as well as the posterior predictive distribution (PPD), distills the PPD into a single deep neural network, and sends this network to the server. Unlike some of the recent Bayesian approaches to federated learning, our approach does not require sending the whole posterior distribution of the parameters from each client to the server but only the PPD in the distilled form as a deep neural network. In addition, when making predictions at test time, it does not require computationally expensive Monte-Carlo averaging over the posterior distribution because our approach always maintains the PPD in form a single deep neural network. Moreover, our approach does not make any restrictive assumptions, such as the form of the clients' posterior distributions, or of their PPDs. We evaluate our approach on classification in federated setting, as well as active learning and OOD detection in federated settings, on which our approach outperforms various existing federated learning baselines.},

In this paper, we propose a novel map-based approach to embedding GPS coordinates using self-supervised learning. Unlike most prior studies that directly embed GPS coordinates to a latent space, we leverage a map-based approach, allowing embeddings to capture geographical and economic features. Namely, we use a student-teacher architecture, where a student network is trained to mimic the outputs of the teacher, using two different augmented versions of the same input. To capture the rich underlying semantics of GPS coordinates, we further leverage auxiliary tasks including \textit{geo} prediction, high-level reconstruction, and intermediate clustering. The intermediate clustering loss facilitates learning features at different levels of granularity, while the high-level reconstruction loss encourages ``local-to-global'' correspondences. We evaluate our method on a large-scale dataset of GPS coordinates and demonstrate that it outperforms several baseline methods in terms of the quality of the learned embeddings. Moreover, we show the usefulness of our embeddings in various downstream tasks, such as predicting land price, land cover type, or water quality indice.},

In contrast with the traditional relation extraction on a single sentence, extracting relations from multiple sentences as a whole will harvest more valuable and richer knowledge. Recently, the Transformer-based pre-trained language models (TPLMs) are widely adopted to tackle document-level relation extraction (DocRE). Graph-based methods, aiming to acquire knowledge between entities to form entity-level relation graphs, have facilitated the rapid development of DocRE by infusing their proposed models with the knowledge. However, beyond entity-level knowledge, we discover many other kinds of knowledge that can aid humans to extract relations. It remains unclear whether and in which way they can be adopted to improve the performance of the Transformer, which affects the maximum performance gain of Transformer-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted multi-channel Transformer (WMCT) to infuse unlimited kinds of knowledge into the vanilla Transformer. Based on WMCT, we also explore five kinds of knowledge to enhance both its reasoning ability and expressive power. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) more knowledge makes the performance of the Transformer better and (2) more informative knowledge leads to more performance gain. We appeal to future Transformer-based work to consider exploring more informative knowledge to improve the performance of the Transformer.},

Analysis of the equivalent model reveals an important yet not fully understood role played by the activation function. To address this issue, we study the "parameters" of the equivalent model to achieve improved generalization performance for a given supervised learning problem. We show that acquired parameters from the Gaussian model enable us to define a set of optimal nonlinearities. We provide two example classes from this set, e.g., second-order polynomial and piecewise linear functions. These functions are optimized to improve generalization performance regardless of the actual form. We experiment with regression and classification problems, including synthetic and real (e.g., CIFAR10) data. Our numerical results validate that the optimized nonlinearities achieve better generalization performance than widely-used nonlinear functions such as ReLU.

	abstract = {Modern DNN-based recommendation systems rely on training-derived embeddings of sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for rarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated infrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior embeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its surprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings training (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer, with an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For inference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a single-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.

Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger than that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the inner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both of these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism modulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple state-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At constant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size, reduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.},

Different types of video modalities can be used in a home setting to detect falls, including RGB, Infrared, and Thermal cameras. Anomaly detection frameworks using autoencoders and their variants can be used for fall detection due to the data imbalance that arises from the rarity and diversity of falls. However, the use of reconstruction error in autoencoders can limit the application of networks' structures that propagate information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities. The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder, an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by $0.20$ AUC ROC for a single camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection.},

Pedestrians' behaviors are usually influenced by their surroundings in traffic scenes. Recent works based on vision-based neural networks extract key information from images to perform prediction. However, in the driving environment, there exists much critical information, such as the social and scene interaction in the driving area, the location and distance between the ego car and target pedestrian, and the motion of all targets. How properly exploring and utilizing the above implicit interactions will promote the development of Autonomous Vehicles. In this chapter, two novel attributes, the pedestrian's location on the road or sidewalk, and the relative distance from the target pedestrian to the ego-car, which are derived from the semantic map and depth map combined with bounding boxes, are introduced. A hybrid prediction network based on multi-modal is proposed to capture the interactions between all the features and predict pedestrian crossing intention.

	abstract = {Temporal Point Processes (TPP) play an important role in predicting or forecasting events. Although these problems have been studied extensively, predicting multiple simultaneously occurring events can be challenging. For instance, more often than not, a patient gets admitted to a hospital with multiple conditions at a time. Similarly people buy more than one stock and multiple news breaks out at the same time. Moreover, these events do not occur at discrete time intervals, and forecasting event sets in the continuous time domain remains an open problem. Na\"ive approaches for extending the existing TPP models for solving this problem lead to dealing with an exponentially large number of events or ignoring set dependencies among events. In this work, we propose a scalable and efficient approach based on TPPs to solve this problem. Our proposed approach incorporates contextual event embeddings, temporal information, and domain features to model the temporal event sets.

MM-NNs extract and fuse features from multiple modalities using adequate unimodal backbones and specific fusion networks. Although this helps strengthen the multimodal information representation, designing such networks is labor-intensive. It requires tuning the architectural parameters of the unimodal backbones, choosing the fusing point, and selecting the operations for fusion. Furthermore, multimodality AI is emerging as a cutting-edge option in Internet of Things (IoT) systems where inference latency and energy consumption are critical metrics in addition to accuracy.

To behave like humans and retain similar performance, ABC-RL augments behavioral limitations as cost signals in reinforcement learning with dynamically adjusted weights. Unlike traditional constrained policy optimization, we propose a new formulation that minimizes the behavioral costs subject to a constraint of the value function. By leveraging the augmented Lagrangian, our approach is an approximation of the Lagrangian adjustment, which handles the trade-off between the performance and the human-like behavior. Through experiments conducted on 3D games in DMLab-30 and Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, we demonstrate that ABC-RL achieves the same performance level while significantly reducing instances of shaking and spinning.

Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial performance burden.
Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages Bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements. In comparison with state-of-the-art techniques MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results, MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by $2900\times$ and performs up to $3.4\times$ faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of the full uncompressed model.},

In this paper, we obviate their complex design and demonstrate that the Nearest neighbours Proxy Triplet (NPT) loss has an intrinsic capability for feature disentanglement. To further enhance the effectiveness of NPT, we propose a novel margin-based loss, namely Adaptive-rank NPT, which naturally separates the identity and attribute features. While a margin-based loss ensures inter-class separability, it imposes no constraints on intra-class compactness. The samples that meet the inter-class margin will not contribute to network training.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel policy that combines Thompson sampling with a computationally efficient approach known as the best challenger rule. While Thompson sampling was originally considered for maximizing the cumulative reward, we demonstrate that it can be used to naturally explore arms in BAI without forcing it. We show that our policy is asymptotically optimal for any two-armed bandit problems and achieves near optimality for general $K$-armed bandit problems for $K \geq 3$. Nevertheless, in numerical experiments, our policy shows competitive performance compared to asymptotically optimal policies in terms of sample complexity while requiring less computation cost.

The memory usage of the CNN model training escalates with the increase in batch size and the complexity of the model. Therefore, a lightweight training method is essential, especially when the computational resources are limited. In this paper, we propose a CNN training mechanism called Facto-CNN, leveraging low-rank tensor factorization and lossy tensor compression to reduce the memory usage required in training the CNN models. Facto-CNN factorizes the weight tensors of convolutional and fully-connected layers and then only updates one of the factorized tensors for each layer, dramatically reducing the feature map size stored in the memory. To further reduce memory consumption, Facto-CNN compresses the feature maps with a simple lossy compression technique that exploits the value similarity in the feature maps. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Facto-CNN reduces the memory usage for storing the feature maps by 68-93\% with a trivial accuracy degradation when training the CNN models.},

In recent years, U-Net and its variants have been widely used in pathology image segmentation tasks. One of the key designs of U-Net is the use of skip connections between the encoder and decoder, which helps to recover detailed information after upsampling. While most variations of U-Net adopt the original skip connection design, there is semantic gap between the encoder and decoder that can negatively impact model performance. Therefore, it is important to reduce this semantic gap before conducting skip connection. To address this issue, we propose a new segmentation network called FusionU-Net, which is based on U-Net structure and incorporates a fusion module to exchange information between different skip connections to reduce semantic gaps. Unlike the other fusion modules in existing networks, ours is based on a two-round fusion design that fully considers the local relevance between adjacent encoder layer outputs and the need for bi-directional information exchange across multiple layers. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple pathology image datasets to evaluate our model and found that FusionU-Net achieves better performance compared to other competing methods. We argue our fusion module is more effective than the designs of existing networks, and it could be easily embedded into other networks to further enhance the model performance.

Inspired by software engineering practices, this paper proposes CompD, a differential testing (DT)-based framework for detecting and repairing prediction deviations on compressed models and their plaintext versions. CompD treats original/compressed models as ``black-box,'' thus offering an efficient method orthogonal to specific different compression schemes.

We conduct link prediction experiments on five different dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TTGCN for dynamic graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in the link prediction task. In addition, our ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of adopting TrussGCN in a dynamic graph embedding method.},

	abstract = {Text detection in medical images is a critical task, essential for automating the extraction of valuable information from diverse healthcare documents. Conventional text detection methods, predominantly based on segmentation, encounter substantial challenges when confronted with text-rich images, extreme aspect ratios, and multi-oriented text. In response to these complexities, this paper introduces an innovative text detection system aimed at enhancing its efficacy. Our proposed system comprises two fundamental components: the Efficient Feature Enhancement Module (EFEM) and the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module (MSFM), both serving as integral elements of the segmentation head. The EFEM incorporates a spatial attention mechanism to improve segmentation performance by introducing multi-level information. The MSFM merges features from the EFEM at different depths and scales to generate final segmentation features. In conjunction with our segmentation methodology, our post-processing module employs a differentiable binarization technique, facilitating adaptive threshold adjustment to enhance text detection precision. To further bolster accuracy and robustness, we introduce the integration of a vision-language pre-training model. Through extensive pretraining on large-scale visual language understanding tasks, this model amasses a wealth of rich visual and semantic representations. When seamlessly integrated with the segmentation module, the pretraining model effectively leverages its potent representation capabilities. Our proposed model undergoes rigorous evaluation on medical text image datasets, consistently demonstrating exceptional performance. Benchmark experiments reaffirm its efficacy.},

In recent years, a variety of spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been proposed to address this task and achieved promising results. However, these networks are typically handcrafted and require extensive human expertise. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies hidden within different scenarios vary, making it difficult for them to adapt to different scenarios. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary neural architecture search framework, entitled EMTSF, for automated STGNN design. Specifically, we employ fine-grained neural architecture search into both the spatial convolution module and the temporal convolution module. For the spatial convolution search space, various feature filtering and neighbor aggregation operations are employed to find the most suitable message-passing mechanism for modeling the spatial dependencies. For the temporal convolution search space, gated temporal convolutions with different kernel sizes are utilized to best capture temporal dependencies with various ranges. The spatial convolution module and temporal convolution module are jointly optimized with the proposed evolutionary search algorithm to heuristically identify the optimal STGNN architecture. Extensive experiments on four commonly used benchmark datasets show EMTSF achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {The cold-start problem poses a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when interaction data is scarce. While meta-learning has shown promise in few-shot classification, its application to cold-start recommendations has mostly involved simple transplantations of generic approaches. The effectiveness of metric learning, a powerful meta-learning method, is hindered by differences in problem definition when applied to rating prediction.

Heterogeneous information networks (HINs), as high-order graph structures, can capture valuable semantic information even in data-starved conditions. Efficient utilization of HINs can alleviate the cold-start dilemma. However, in the cold-start domain, there is a lack of dynamic node-level and semantic-level feature fusion schemes, resulting in the underutilization of complex information.

This study addresses these issues by combining metric learning and HINs, proposing OMHIN (Dynamic Offset Metric approach to Heterogeneous Information Networks). Our approach transforms a direct similarity metric into an indirect metric to enhance model robustness. By flexibly applying one-dimensional convolution, OMHIN effectively integrates rich information from HINs while minimizing noise introduction.

Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that OMHIN achieves state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios, particularly in complex and challenging situations. It is especially suitable for sequence cold-start recommendations.},

However, the technique of continuous learning (CL) has an issue with catastrophic forgetting, and effective continuous learning methods can only be attained by effectively limiting forgetting and learning new tasks. In this study, we offer the Classifier Expander(CE) method, which combines the regularization-based and replay-based approaches. By undergoing two stages of training, it fulfills the aforementioned standards. The training content for the new task is limited to the portion of the network relevant to that task in the first stage, which uses the replay approach to reduce the forgetting problem. This strategy minimizes disruption to the old task while facilitating efficient learning of the new one. Utilizing all of the data available, the second stage retrains the network and sufficiently trains the classifier to balance the learning performance of the old and new tasks. Our method regularly outperforms previous CL methods on the CIFAR-100 and CUB-200 datasets, obtaining an average improvement of 2.94\% on the class-incremental learning and 1.16\% on the task-incremental learning compared to the best method currently available.

Deep and complex models are able to solve difficult tasks with super-human precision. But for manufacturing quality control, in theory a ideal match for these methods, the step from proof-of-concept towards live deployment is often not feasible. One major obstacle is the unreliability of Machine Learning predictions when confronted with data diverging from the known characteristics. While overall accuracy is high, wrong results may be returned with no indication of their uncertainty. In manufacturing, where scarce errors mean great damages, additional safety measures are required.

In this work, I present Visual Machine Learning Control (VMLC), an approach developed upon a real world visual quality control system that operates in a high throughput manufacturing line. Instead of applying sole classification or anomaly detection, both is done in combination. A scalar metric derived from an Auto-Encoder reconstruction error measures the compliance of captured images with the training data the system is trained on.

To address this issue, partial quantization methods have been proposed to partially reduce the weight parameters of neural network models. However, the accuracy of existing methods degrades rapidly with increasing compression ratio. Although retraining can compensate for this issue to some extent, it is computationally very expensive. In this study, we propose a mixed-precision quantization algorithm without retraining or degradation in accuracy. In the proposed method, first, the difference between values after and before quantization losses of each channel in the layers of the pretrained model is calculated for all channels. Next, the layers are divided into two groups called semilayers according to whether the loss difference is positive or negative. The priorities for quantization in the semilayers are determined based on the Kulback-Leibler divergence derived from the probability distribution of the softmax output after and before quantization. The same process is repeated as a mixed-precision quantization while gradually decreasing the bitwidth, for example, with 8-, 6-, and 4-bit quantizations, and so forth. The results of an experimental evaluation show that the proposed method successfully compressed a ResNet-18 model by 81.44\%, a ResNet-34 model by 84.25\%, and a ResNet-50 model by 80.39\% on image classification tasks using the ImageNet dataset, and a ResNet-18 model by 80.56\% on image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset, with no degradation of the inference accuracy of the pretrained models.},

Existing methods often assume a discrete search space with a finite set of data points for function evaluations and estimating the level sets. When applied to a continuous search space, these methods often need to first discretize the space which leads to poor results while needing high computational time. While some methods cater for the continuous setting, they still lack a proper guarantee for theoretical convergence. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that does not need any discretization and can directly work in continuous search spaces. Our method suggests points by constructing an acquisition function that is defined as a measure of confidence of the function being higher or lower than the given threshold.

Machine Learning (ML) models often rely on large, diverse datasets for optimal performance. Hence, when an individual exercises the RTBF, it can impact the ML model's performance and accuracy. In the context of Federated Learning (FL), where a server trains a model across multiple decentralized devices without moving data away from clients, implementing the RTBF in FL presents some unique challenges compared to traditional ML approaches. For instance, the decentralized nature makes it challenging to identify and remove specific user data from the model.

However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used as the backbone for object detection architectures typically neglect Nyquist's sampling theorem during down-sampling operations, resulting in aliasing and degraded performance. This is likely to be a particular issue for tiny objects that occupy very few pixels and therefore have high spatial frequency features. This paper applied an existing approach WaveCNet for anti-aliasing to tiny object detection. WaveCNet addresses aliasing by replacing standard down-sampling processes in CNNs with Wavelet Pooling (WaveletPool) layers, effectively suppressing aliasing. We modify the original WaveCNet to apply WaveletPool in a consistent way in both pathways of the residual blocks in ResNets. Additionally, we also propose a bottom-heavy version of the backbone, which further improves the performance of tiny object detection while also reducing the required number of parameters by almost half.

One proposed remedy is a post hoc investigation of how the model differs from reality, by explicitly modeling the discrepancy between the two. In this paper, we use transformed Gaussian processes as flexible models for this. Our formulation relaxes the assumption on the correctness of the model by assuming it is only correct in expectation, and it directly supports both additive and multiplicative corrections, treated separately in the literature, using suitable transformations. We demonstrate the approach in two example cases: modeling human growth (relation age-height) and modeling the risk attitude (relation reward-utility).

Thinprep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the best early detection method for cervical cancer as determined by the WHO. As the coverage of early detection of cervical cancer increases, the number of samples in hospitals increases annually, and the pressure on the pathologists to read the cytological images increases, which easily leads to an increase in the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Therefore, automatic detection of abnormal cells in cervical cytology images of cervical fluid using deep learning techniques has become a hot research topic today. However, existing deep learning models for cell detection often collect a single data source from a medical institution for construction. Different medical institutions have different equipment and staining methods, and the accuracy, magnification, and staining results of the images obtained will be different. As a result, the application performance of the model in different medical institution data is not good, and there is a problem of domain shift. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method for cervical fluid-based cell detection based on causal feature extraction. The method is based on the one-stage detection model RetinaNet, and incorporates causal autoencoder to learn the invariant causal feature representation from data. It reduces the impact of task-irrelevant feature representations, reduces the variability of feature distributions in different datasets, and effectively solves the domain shift problem. The addition of deformable convolution and attention mechanism enhances the feature extraction capability for foreground categories with variable shapes in cervical fluid-based pathology images. This reduces the impact of possible strong correlation between background features and goal cells, and reduces the interference of the foreground categories by fading and lack of brightness in the staining. The generalization ability of the model is improved, which makes the model better applicable to different medical institutions. The experimental results show that the method in this paper not only improves the accuracy of the model detection, but also verifies its good generalization effect on different datasets.},

Thus, in this paper, we present a simple but efficient segmentation adapter, termed as SegAdapter, which can be plugged into the pretrained vision backbone to improve the performance of existing models for image semantic segmentation. We summarize SegAdapter with three attractive advantages: 1) SegAdapter is a plug-and-play module demonstrating strong adaptability in CNN and Transformer based models such as ConvNext and Segformer, 2) SegAdapter applies a light-weight High-order Spatial Attention (HSA) to make use of intermediate features from the pretrained backbone which extends the model depth and produces auxiliary segmentation maps for model enhancement, 3) SegAdapter builds a powerful vision backbone by incorporating the semantic context into each stage which takes on some of the functions of the segmentation head. So, SegAdapter augmented model can be used in simple designed decode head to avoid heavy computational cost. By plugging multiple SegAdapter layers into different vision backbones, we construct a series of SegAdapter-based segmentation models.

By modeling these multiple behaviors, models can better capture the user intent and make more effective recommendations.

In addition, most existing multi-behavior methods focus only on predicting a single target behavior and fail to achieve a unified model for predicting the next user-item interaction across multiple behavior types.

To address these limitations, we introduce reinforcement learning to the multi-behavior session-based recommendation task and propose a novel approach called the multi-behavior graph reinforcement learning network (MB-GRL).

The size and severity of wildfires in the region have been increasing in recent years, making it a pressing concern for communities, ecosystems, and the economy. The accurate and timely detection of active wildfires in remote areas is crucial for effective wildfire management and mitigation efforts. In this research paper, we propose a robust approach for detecting active wildfires using multispectral satellite imagery by leveraging vision transformers and a vast repository of landsat-$8$ satellite data with a $30$m spatial resolution in North America. Our methodology involves experimenting with vision transformers and deep convolutional neural networks for wildfire detection in multispectral satellite images. We compare the capabilities of these two architecture families in detecting wildfires within the multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, we propose a novel u-shape vision transformer that effectively captures spatial dependencies and learns meaningful representations from multispectral images, enabling precise discrimination between wildfire and non-wildfire regions. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conducted experiments on a comprehensive dataset of wildfire incidents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately detecting active wildfires with an \textit{Dice Score or F$1$} of $\%90.05$ and \textit{Recall} of $\%89.61$ . Overall, our research presents a promising approach for leveraging vision transformers for multispectral satellite imagery to detect remote wildfires.},

Our work explores this phenomenon in graph neural networks by investigating differences between models differing only in their initializations in their utilized features for predictions. We propose a novel metric called Influence Difference (ID) to quantify the variation in reasons used by nodes across models by comparing their influence distribution. Additionally, we consider the differences between nodes with a stable and an unstable prediction, positing that both equally utilize different reasons and thus provide a meaningful gradient signal to closely match two models even when the predictions for nodes are similar. Based on our analysis, we propose to minimize this ID in Knowledge Distillation, a domain where a new model should closely match an established one. As an efficient approximation, we introduce DropDistillation (DD) that matches the output for a graph perturbed by edge deletions. Our empirical evaluation of six benchmark datasets for node classification validates the differences in utilized features.

Although learning in such MDPs is a priori easier than in fully unknown ones, they are still largely challenging as they include as special cases large classes of problems such as combinatorial semi-bandits. Leveraging the knowledge on transition function in regret minimization, in a statistically efficient way, appears largely unexplored. As it is conjectured that achieving exact optimality in generic MDPs is NP-hard, even with known transitions, we focus on a computationally efficient relaxation, at the cost of achieving order-optimal logarithmic regret instead of exact optimality. We contribute to filling this gap by introducing a novel algorithm based on the popular Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence strategy for bandits. A key component of the proposed algorithm is a carefully designed stopping criterion leveraging the recurrent classes induced by stationary policies. We derive a non-asymptotic, problem-dependent, and logarithmic regret bound for this algorithm, which relies on a novel regret decomposition leveraging the structure.

The well-known Weisfeiler and Lehman (WL) isomorphism test has been widely used to assess GNNs' ability to distinguish graph structures. However, despite being considered less expressive than other GNNs in graph-level tasks based on the WL test, two prominent GNN models, namely graph convolution networks (GCN) and attention-based graph networks (GAT), still exhibit strong performance in node-level classification tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of their expressive power using a novel evaluation metric: the number of linear regions. We demonstrate that by enhancing GCN with refined graph Ricci curvature, our proposed high-rank graph convolution network (HRGCN) can match or even surpass the prediction advantage of attention models. Thus, the two models exhibit equivalent node-level expressive powers. This fresh perspective highlights the evaluation of GNNs' expressive power in node-level classifications rather than solely at the graph level.

Motivated by approaches on TTV models adapting from diffusion-based TTI models, we suggest the text-guided video editing framework given only a pretrained TTI model and a single <text, video> pair, which we term Edit-A-Video. The framework consists of two stages: (1) inflating the 2D model into the 3D model by appending temporal modules and tuning on the source video (2) inverting the source video into the noise and editing with target text through attention map injection. Each stage enables the temporal modeling and preservation of semantic attributes of the source video. One of the key challenges for video editing is a background inconsistency problem, where the regions unrelated to the edit suffer from undesirable and inconsistent temporal alterations. To mitigate this issue, we also introduce a novel mask blending method, termed as temporal-consistent blending (TC Blending). We improve previous mask blending methods to reflect the temporal consistency, ensuring that the area where the editing is applied exhibits smooth transition while also achieving spatio-temporal consistency of the unedited regions. We present extensive experimental results over various types of text and videos, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to baselines in terms of background consistency, text alignment, and video editing quality.

Shipping cost of these packages are used on the day of shipping (day 0) to estimate profitability of sales. Downstream systems utilize these days 0 profitability estimates to make financial decisions, such as pricing strategies and delisting loss-making products. However, obtaining accurate shipping cost estimates on day 0 is complex for reasons like delay in carrier invoicing or fixed cost components getting recorded at monthly cadence. Inaccurate shipping cost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high, or promoting the wrong product to the customers. Current solutions for estimating shipping costs on day 0 rely on tree-based models that require extensive manual engineering efforts. In this study, we propose a novel architecture called the Rate Card Transformer (RCT) that uses self-attention to encode all package shipping information such as package attributes, carrier information and route plan. Unlike other transformer-based tabular models, RCT has the ability to encode a variable list of one-to-many relations of a shipment, allowing it to capture more information about a shipment. For example, RCT can encode properties of all products in a package. Our results demonstrate that cost predictions made by the RCT have 28.82\% less error compared to tree-based GBDT model. Moreover, the RCT outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer-based tabular model, FTTransformer, by 6.08\%. We also illustrate that the RCT learns a generalized manifold of the rate card that can improve the performance of tree-based models.},

This concentration property leads to a restricted ability to learn the parity bit efficiently using gradient-based methods, irrespective of the complexity of the network architecture being trained.

Our proof relies on Boas-Bellman inequality in inner product spaces and it involves establishing approximate orthogonality of discrete logarithm's parity bit functions through the spectral norm of certain matrices.

However, existing SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g., GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: \textit{Can we train SSL models without real unlabeled datasets?} Instead of using real unlabeled datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are to identify synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation models and to train classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this, our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i) meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii), we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled data.},

	abstract = {As the most commonly used quantization techniques for deep neural networks, the int-only quantization methods use scale factor to linearly approximate the weights or activation of each layer. However, when passing activation data between layers, such int-only quantization methods require extra Scale Factor Conversion (SFC) operations, resulting in computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a Group-Wise Quantization framework, called GWQ, to reduce computational consumption during the activation data pass process by allowing multiple layers share one scale factor in SFC operations. Specifically, in the GWQ framework, we propose two algorithms for network layers grouping and model training. For the grouping of network layers, we propose a grouping algorithm based on the similarity of data numerical distribution. Then, the network layers divided into the same group will be quantified using the same common scale factor to reduce the computational consumption. Considering the additional performance loss caused by sharing scale factors among multiple layers, we propose a training algorithm to optimize these shared scale factors and model parameters, by designing a learnable power-of-two scaling parameter for each layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GWQ framework is able to effectively reduce the computational burden during inference, while maintaining model performance with negligible impact.},

	abstract = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that operate in an event-driven manner and employ binary spike representation have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy-efficient computing. However, a cost bottleneck arises in obtaining high-performance SNNs: training a SNN model requires a large number of time steps in addition to the usual learning iterations, hence this limits their energy efficiency. This paper proposes a general training framework that enhances feature learning and activation efficiency within a limited time step, providing a new solution for more energy-efficient SNNs. 
Our framework allows SNN neurons to learn robust spike feature from different receptive fields and update neuron states by utilizing both current stimuli and recurrence information transmitted from other neurons. This setting continuously complements information within a single time step. Additionally, we propose a projection function to merge these two stimuli to smoothly optimize neuron weights (spike firing threshold and activation). We evaluate the proposal for both convolution and recurrent models. Our experimental results indicate state-of-the-art visual classification tasks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Our framework achieves 72.41\% and 72.31\% top-1 accuracy with only 1 time step on CIFAR100 for CNNs and RNNs, respectively. Our method reduces 10X and 3X joule energy than a standard ANN and SNN, respectively, on CIFAR10, without additional time steps.},

	abstract = {Neural Networks (NN) are increasingly used for image classification in medical, transportation, and security devices. However, recent studies have revealed neural networks' vulnerability against adversarial examples generated by adding small perturbations to images. These malicious samples are imperceptible by human eyes, but can give rise to misclassification by NN models. Defensive distillation is a defence mechanism in which the NN's output probabilities are scaled to a user-defined range and used as labels to train a new model less sensitive to input perturbations. Despite initial success, defensive distillation was defeated by state-of-the-art attacks. A proposed countermeasure was to add noise in the inference time to hamper the adversarial attack which also decreased the model accuracy. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a two-phase training methodology to defend against adversarial attacks. In the first phase, we train architecturally diversified models individually using the cross-entropy loss function. In the second phase, we train the ensemble using a diversity-promoting loss function. Our experimental results show that our training methodology and noise addition in the inference time improved our ensemble's resistance against adversarial attacks, while maintaining reasonable accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The salp swarm algorithm(SSA) has been successfully used to solve the feature selection problem due to its fast convergence and simple structure. However, existing SSA-based methods still suffer from the issue of low classification accuracy due to the problem of getting trapped in local optima. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method for classification based on SSA, which can continuously generate new sub-populations to improve the search environment of the main population. Specifically, a flip-prohibition(F-P) operator is first proposed to help the main population, which may currently fall into a local optimum, find a new and more promising region. A multi-surrogate technique is suggested to evaluate the region to determine the position of sub-populations, which can reduce the high computational cost. In addition, a population initialization method is developed according to the importance of features and the dimensionality of the dataset. Finally, a communication mechanism is presented to enable different sub-populations to learn from each other. By comparing the proposed method with other 6 feature selection methods on 16 datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method has better classification ability and can select a smaller feature subset in most cases.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose ``Cell Variational Information Bottleneck Network (cellVIB)'', a convolutional neural network using information bottleneck mechanism, which can be combined with the latest feedforward network architecture in an end-to-end training method. Our Cell Variational Information Bottleneck Network is constructed by stacking VIB cells, which generate feature maps with uncertainty. As layers going deeper, the regularization effect will gradually increase, instead of directly adding excessive regular constraints to the output layer of the model as in Deep VIB. In each VIB cell, the feedforward process learns an independent mean term and a standard deviation term, and predicts the Gaussian distribution based on them. The feedback process is based on reparameterization trick for effective training.

This work performs an extensive analysis on MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of each VIB cells mentioned above, and provides an insightful analysis on how the VIB cells affect mutual information. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 also prove that our network is robust against noisy labels during training and against corrupted images during testing. Then, we validate our method on PACS dataset, whose results show that the VIB cells can significantly improve the generalization performance of the basic model. Finally, in a more complex representation learning task, face recognition, our network structure has also achieved very competitive results.},

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their great power in learning graph-structured data. Due to the limitations of expensive labeled data, contrastive learning has been applied in graph domain. We propose GWGCL, a graph contrastive learning method based on feature group whitening to achieve two key properties of contrastive learning: alignment and uniformity. GWGCL achieves the alignment by ensuring consistency between positive samples. There is no need for negative samples to participate, but rather to achieve the uniformity between samples through whitening. Because whitening has the effect of feature divergence, it avoids the collapse of all sample representations to a single point, which is called dimensional collapse. Moreover, GWGCL can achieve better results and higher efficiency without the need for asymmetric networks, projection layers, stopping gradients and complex loss function. Through extensive experiments, GWGCL performs competitively on node classification and graph classification tasks across ten common graph datasets.The code is in: https://github.com/MR9812/GWGCL.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces two key contributions aimed at improving the speed and quality of images generated through inverse diffusion processes. The first contribution involves reparameterizing the diffusion process in terms of the angle on a quarter-circular arc between the image and noise, specifically setting the conventional $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}}=\cos(\eta)$. This reparameterization eliminates two singularities and allows for the expression of diffusion evolution as a well-behaved ordinary differential equation (ODE). In turn, this allows higher order ODE solvers such as Runge-Kutta methods to be used effectively. The second contribution is to directly estimate both the image ($\mathbf{x}_0$) and noise ($\mathbf{\epsilon}$) using our network, which enables more stable calculations of the update step in the inverse diffusion steps, as accurate estimation of both the image and noise are crucial at different stages of the process. Together with these changes, our model achieves faster generation, with the ability to converge on high-quality images more quickly, and higher quality of the generated images, as measured by metrics such as Fr{\'e}chet Inception Distance (FID), spatial Fr{\'e}chet Inception Distance (sFID), precision, and recall.},

	abstract = {In scenarios where there is an imbalance between positive and negative examples, hard example mining strategies have been shown to improve recognition performance by assisting models in distinguishing subtle differences between positive and negative examples. However, overly strict mining strategies may introduce false negative examples, while implementing the mining strategy can disrupt the difficulty distribution of examples in the real dataset and cause overfitting on difficult examples in the model. Therefore, in this paper, we explore how to balance the difficulty of mined examples in order to obtain and exploit high-quality negative examples, and try to solve the problem in terms of both loss function and training strategy. The proposed balance loss provides an effective discriminant for the quality of negative examples by incorporating a self-supervised approach into the loss function, employing dynamic gradient modulation to achieve finer adjustment for examples of different difficulties. The proposed annealing training strategy constrains the difficulty of negative examples drawn from mining and uses examples of decreasing difficulty to mitigate the overfitting issue of hard negative examples in training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our new sparse descriptors outperform previously established state-of-the-art sparse descriptors.},

Existing data on autonomous driving in this area is limited in both perspective and duration.

However, most of the existing CGNNs perform low-pass filtering in nature, as they are derived from discrete Laplacian-smoothing based graph neural networks (GNNs). While prior research has shown the promising results of high-pass filtering for node representation learning, particularly on heterophilous graphs, there remains a need to extend it to continuous domain and explore the synergy between two filtering channels. In this paper, by leveraging low-pass and high-pass filtering, we propose a novel dual-channel continuous graph neural network architecture to address this gap. In particular, we introduce a dimension masking method to coordinate the contribution of all low and high pass filtered feature dimensions to node classification. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the link between high and low filters, unraveling their distinct roles in learning node representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments focusing on the node classification task of heterophilous graphs.

Septal myectomy surgery has been recognized as the gold standard for non-pharmacological therapy of HOCM, in which aortic and mitral valves are critical regions for surgical planning.Currently, manual segmentation of aortic and mitral valves is widely performed in clinical practice to construct 3D models used for HOCM surgical planning. Such a process, however, is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we integrate anatomical prior knowledge into deep learning for automatic segmentation of aortic and mitral valves.In particular, a two-stage method is proposed: we first obtain the region of interest (RoI) from a CT image, where heart segmentation is then performed. The spatial relationship between heart substructures is utilized to identify a valve region that contains the aortic and mitral valves. Unlike typical two-stage methods, we feed the refined segmentation of the left ventricle, left atrium, and aorta as additional input for the valve segmentation. By incorporating this anatomical prior knowledge, deep neural networks (DNNs) can leverage the surrounding anatomical structures to improve valve segmentation. We collected a dataset of 27 CT images from patients with a medical history of septal myectomy surgery.Experimental results show that our method achieves an average Dice score of 71.2\% and an improvement of 4.2\% over existing methods.},

	abstract = {Sequential maximization of expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used policies in Bayesian optimization because of its simplicity and ability to handle noisy observations. In particular, the improvement function often uses the best posterior mean as the best incumbent in noisy settings. However, the uncertainty associated with the incumbent solution is often neglected in many analytic EI-type methods: a closed-form acquisition function is derived in the noise-free setting, but then applied to the setting with noisy observations. To address this limitation, we propose a modification of EI that corrects its closed-form expression by incorporating the covariance information provided by the Gaussian Process (GP) model. This acquisition function specializes to the classical noise-free result, and we argue should replace that formula in Bayesian optimization software packages, tutorials, and textbooks. This enhanced acquisition provides good generality for noisy and noiseless settings. We show that our method achieves a sublinear convergence rate on the cumulative regret bound under heteroscedastic observation noise. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed acquisition function can outperform EI in the presence of noisy observations on benchmark functions for black-box optimization, as well as on parameter search for neural network model compression.},
