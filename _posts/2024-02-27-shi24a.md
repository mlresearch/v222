abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive achievements
  in diverse graph tasks, and research on their expressive power has experienced significant
  growth in recent years. The well-known Weisfeiler and Lehman (WL) isomorphism test
  has been widely used to assess GNNs’ ability to distinguish graph structures. However,
  despite being considered less expressive than other GNNs in graph-level tasks based
  on the WL test, two prominent GNN models, namely graph convolution networks (GCN)
  and attention-based graph networks (GAT), still exhibit strong performance in node-level
  classification tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of their
  expressive power using a novel evaluation metric: the number of linear regions.
  We demonstrate that by enhancing GCN with refined graph Ricci curvature, our proposed
  high-rank graph convolution network (HRGCN) can match or even surpass the prediction
  advantage of attention models. Thus, the two models exhibit equivalent node-level
  expressive powers. This fresh perspective highlights the evaluation of GNNs’ expressive
  power in node-level classifications rather than solely at the graph level. Experimental
  results showcase that the proposed HRGCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art
  in various classification and prediction tasks.'
