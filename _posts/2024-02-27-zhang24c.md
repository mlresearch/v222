abstract: In scenarios where there is an imbalance between positive and negative examples,
  hard example mining strategies have been shown to improve recognition performance
  by assisting models in distinguishing subtle differences between positive and negative
  examples. However, overly strict mining strategies may introduce false negative
  examples, while implementing the mining strategy can disrupt the difficulty distribution
  of examples in the real dataset and cause overfitting on difficult examples in the
  model. Therefore, in this paper, we explore how to balance the difficulty of mined
  examples in order to obtain and exploit high-quality negative examples, and try
  to solve the problem in terms of both loss function and training strategy. The proposed
  balance loss provides an effective discriminant for the quality of negative examples
  by incorporating a self-supervised approach into the loss function, employing dynamic
  gradient modulation to achieve finer adjustment for examples of different difficulties.
  The proposed annealing training strategy constrains the difficulty of negative examples
  drawn from mining and uses examples of decreasing difficulty to mitigate the overfitting
  issue of hard negative examples in training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
  our new sparse descriptors outperform previously established state-of-the-art sparse
  descriptors.
