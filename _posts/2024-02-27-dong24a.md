abstract: Forecasting the crossing intention of pedestrians is an essential task for
  the safe driving of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in the real world. Pedestrians’ behaviors
  are usually influenced by their surroundings in traffic scenes. Recent works based
  on vision-based neural networks extract key information from images to perform prediction.
  However, in the driving environment, there exists much critical information, such
  as the social and scene interaction in the driving area, the location and distance
  between the ego car and target pedestrian, and the motion of all targets. How properly
  exploring and utilizing the above implicit interactions will promote the development
  of Autonomous Vehicles. In this chapter, two novel attributes, the pedestrian’s
  location on the road or sidewalk, and the relative distance from the target pedestrian
  to the ego-car, which are derived from the semantic map and depth map combined with
  bounding boxes, are introduced. A hybrid prediction network based on multi-modal
  is proposed to capture the interactions between all the features and predict pedestrian
  crossing intention. Evaluated by two public pedestrian crossing datasets, PIE and
  JAAD, the proposed hybrid framework outperforms the state-of-the-art by about an
  accuracy of 3%.
