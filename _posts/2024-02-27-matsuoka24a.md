abstract: "\\emph{Finding diverse solutions} to combinatorial optimization problems
  is beneficial for a deeper understanding of complicated real-world problems and
  for simpler and more practical mathematical modeling. For this purpose, it is desirable
  that every solution is far away from one another and that solutions can be found
  in time not depending polynomially on the size of the family of feasible solutions.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding diverse sets in the sense of
  maximizing the \\emph{minimum} of \\emph{weighted Hamming distance} between \\emph{set
  pairs}. Under a particular assumption, we provide an algorithm that gives diverse
  sets of almost $\\mu /2$-approximation in expectation in the sense of maximization
  of the minimum of the expected value, where $\\mu \\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter on
  a subroutine. We further give a hardness result that any approximation ratio better
  than $2/3$ is impossible in polynomial time under the assumption of $\\mathrm{P}
  \\neq \\mathrm{NP}$."
