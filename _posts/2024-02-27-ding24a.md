abstract: The loss landscape of neural networks is a valuable perspective for studying
  the trainability, generalization, and robustness of networks, and hence its visualization
  has been extensively studied. Essentially, visualization methods project the parameter
  space into a low-dimensional subspace, resulting in a substantial loss of network
  parameter information. The key is to identify the direction of loss reduction in
  the visualized loss landscape. However, the existing methods generally focus on
  one simple point, make it challenging to properly capture the main properties of
  the landscape. An obvious and important problem is that regardless of whether the
  center point is the convergence or not, the current methods may depict it a local
  optimal point in the visualization. To address this issue, we propose a visualization
  method that relies on the whole training process not a single solution, better reflecting
  the actual training loss.
