abstract: With the development of deep learning, breakthroughs in single image super-resolution
  have been achieved. However, most existing methods are limited to using only spatial
  domain information or only frequency domain information, and the rich information
  of the image in the frequency domain space is not fully utilized, so it is still
  difficult to recover satisfactory texture details. In this paper, we propose a method
  to fuse the frequency domain and spatial domain information. Our method uses a two-branch
  network to extract the spatial domain information and the frequency domain information
  separately and uses a fusion module to fuse the different information in the two
  domains. We also use the Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) to preserve the
  texture directionality well, and design two NSST-based directional texture enhancement
  modules, which are embedded in different parts of the network, to enhance the recovery
  of texture details in the image reconstruction process. Quantitative and qualitative
  experimental results show that the method outperforms advanced single-image super-resolution
  methods in recovering images.
