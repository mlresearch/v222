abstract: CT scans significantly improve analytical competencies but uses X-Rays which
  will produce ionizing radiation that bring higher radiation to the living tissues.
  Thus, optimization of CT radiation dose has a significant concern to lower the health
  risks. Many manufacturers have done a greater contribution by developing technologies
  to reduce dosage by maintaining image quality by adding noise reduction filters,
  automatic exposure control, and using many iterative reconstruction algorithms.
  Image reconstruction algorithms play a vital role in maintaining or improving image
  quality in reduced-dose CT. The present research work combines the state-of-the-art
  reconstruction technique Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART)
  with a Residual U-Net network to generate images from limited number of sinograms.
  The proposed model is trained using sinograms corresponding head and neck and head
  CT images of 10 patients. The proposed model predicted superior diagnostic quality
  images with max PSNR of 70.23 and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
  0.99. Thus the proposed model, SART-Res-Unet, ensures a very low radiation exposure
  to a patient during the repeated CT imaging sequence, which is an inevitable part
  of radiotherapy.
