abstract: 'We consider the challenge of establishing relationships between samples
  in distinct domains, A and B, using supervised data that captures the intrinsic
  relationships within each domain. In other words, we present a semi-supervised setting
  in which there are no labeled mixed-domain pairs of samples. Our method is derived
  based on a generalization bound and incorporates supervised terms for each domain,
  a domain confusion term on the learned features, and a consistency term for domain-specific
  relationships when considering mixed-domain sample pairs. Our findings showcase
  the efficacy of our approach in two disparate domains: (i) Predicting protein-protein
  interactions between viruses and hosts by modeling genetic sequences. (ii) Forecasting
  link connections within citation graphs using graph neural networks.'
