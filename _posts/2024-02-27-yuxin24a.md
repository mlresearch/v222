abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly applied to analyze real-world
  graph-structured data. However, GNNs are sensitive to the given graph structure,
  which cast importance on graph structure learning to find optimal graph structures
  and representations. Previous methods have been restricted from large graphs due
  to high computational complexity. Lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that there
  exists a subnetwork that has comparable or better performance with proto-networks,
  which has been transferred to suit for pruning GNNs recently. There are few studies
  that address lottery ticket hypothesisâ€™s performance on defense in graphs. In this
  paper, we propose a scalable graph structure learning method leveraging lottery
  (ticket) hypothesis : GSL-LH. Our experiments show that GSL-LH can outperform its
  backbone model without attack and show better robustness against attack, achieving
  state-of-the-art performances in regular-size graphs compared to other graph structure
  learning methods without feature augmentation. In large graphs, GSL-LH can have
  comparable results with state-of-the-art defense methods other than graph structure
  learning, while bringing some insights into explanation of robustness.'
