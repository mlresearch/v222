abstract: Micro defects, such as casting pores in industrial products, have been detected
  by human visual inspection using X-ray CT images and image processing tools. Automatic
  detection of micro defects is challenging for anomaly detection methods using image
  reconstruction errors and nearest neighbor distances because these metrics are dominated
  by low-frequency information and are insensitive to minor defects. Although recent
  methods achieve high anomaly detection performances, their detection abilities are
  insufficient for micro defects. To overcome these problems, we propose to extend
  a state-of-the-art anomaly detection method by introducing frequency-dependent losses
  to capture reconstruction errors appearing around micro defects and frequency-dependent
  data augmentation to improve the sensitivity against the errors. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments with MVTec AD dataset
  especially on the detection of micro defects.
