abstract: Through ground-breaking advances in Machine Learning its real-world applications
  have become commonplace in many areas over the past decade. Deep and complex models
  are able to solve difficult tasks with super-human precision. But for manufacturing
  quality control, in theory a ideal match for these methods, the step from proof-of-concept
  towards live deployment is often not feasible. One major obstacle is the unreliability
  of Machine Learning predictions when confronted with data diverging from the known
  characteristics. While overall accuracy is high, wrong results may be returned with
  no indication of their uncertainty. In manufacturing, where scarce errors mean great
  damages, additional safety measures are required. In this work, I present Visual
  Machine Learning Control (VMLC), an approach developed upon a real world visual
  quality control system that operates in a high throughput manufacturing line. Instead
  of applying sole classification or anomaly detection, both is done in combination.
  A scalar metric derived from an Auto-Encoder reconstruction error measures the compliance
  of captured images with the training data the system is trained on. This metric
  is integrated into the widely used framework of industrial Statistical Process Control
  (SPC), significantly increasing robustness through meaningful control limits and
  enabling active learning. The system is evaluated on a large dataset of real-world
  industrial welding images.
