abstract: The right to be forgotten (RTBF) is a concept that pertains to an individual’s
  right to request the removal or deletion of their personal information when it is
  no longer necessary, relevant, or accurate for the purposes for which it was initially
  collected. Machine Learning (ML) models often rely on large, diverse datasets for
  optimal performance. Hence, when an individual exercises the RTBF, it can impact
  the ML model’s performance and accuracy. In the context of Federated Learning (FL),
  where a server trains a model across multiple decentralized devices without moving
  data away from clients, implementing the RTBF in FL presents some unique challenges
  compared to traditional ML approaches. For instance, the decentralized nature makes
  it challenging to identify and remove specific user data from the model. Although
  various unlearning methods have been proposed in the literature, they have not been
  well investigated from the efficiency perspective. To fill this gap, this paper
  presents an empirical study to investigate the impacts of various unlearning methods.
  Our experiments are designed in diverse scenarios involving multiple communication
  and unlearning rounds using three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. We utilize
  backdoor attack and Cosine Similarity to assess the effectiveness of each unlearning
  method. The findings and insights from this research can be integrated into FL systems
  to enhance their overall performance and effectiveness. Our research codes are available
