abstract: Recent Continuous Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs) have attracted great attention
  due to its merits of infinite depth without oversmoothing. However, most of the
  existing CGNNs perform low-pass filtering in nature, as they are derived from discrete
  Laplacian-smoothing based graph neural networks (GNNs). While prior research has
  shown the promising results of high-pass filtering for node representation learning,
  particularly on heterophilous graphs, there remains a need to extend it to continuous
  domain and explore the synergy between two filtering channels. In this paper, by
  leveraging low-pass and high-pass filtering, we propose a novel dual-channel continuous
  graph neural network architecture to address this gap. In particular, we introduce
  a dimension masking method to coordinate the contribution of all low and high pass
  filtered feature dimensions to node classification. Our aim is to deepen the understanding
  of the link between high and low filters, unraveling their distinct roles in learning
  node representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct
  extensive experiments focusing on the node classification task of heterophilous
  graphs. Our results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach, showcasing
  its robustness to oversmoothing.
