abstract: Many research works focus on the robustness of convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs) on image classification. Diversity loss has been demonstrated to be an effective
  method to boost robustness. However, the existing diversity losses did not fully
  consider the strong correlation between regional features when filters are locally
  activated. They focused on improving filter responses constraint with classification
  loss. However, diversity loss has deeper optimization space. We explore the combinations
  of different filter diversity losses and feature diversity losses. We enhance the
  orthogonality between pair-wise filters to make them more diverse and penalize irrelevance
  between regional response mappings. We make multiple combinations and propose several
  methods on improving orthogonality, which have different adaptations for different
  datasets and network models. We evaluate their effectiveness in experiment. Our
  combinations could improve the efficiency of robust image recognition.
