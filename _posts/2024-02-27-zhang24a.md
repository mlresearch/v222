abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their great power in learning
  graph-structured data. Due to the limitations of expensive labeled data, contrastive
  learning has been applied in graph domain. We propose GWGCL, a graph contrastive
  learning method based on feature group whitening to achieve two key properties of
  contrastive learning: alignment and uniformity. GWGCL achieves the alignment by
  ensuring consistency between positive samples. There is no need for negative samples
  to participate, but rather to achieve the uniformity between samples through whitening.
  Because whitening has the effect of feature divergence, it avoids the collapse of
  all sample representations to a single point, which is called dimensional collapse.
  Moreover, GWGCL can achieve better results and higher efficiency without the need
  for asymmetric networks, projection layers, stopping gradients and complex loss
  function. Through extensive experiments, GWGCL performs competitively on node classification
  and graph classification tasks across ten common graph datasets.The code is in:
