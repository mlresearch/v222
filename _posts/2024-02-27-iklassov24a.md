abstract: This study addresses a gap in the utilization of Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in solving the Stochastic Vehicle Routing
  Problem (SVRP) that involves the challenging task of optimizing vehicle routes under
  uncertain conditions. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that comprehensively
  addresses the key sources of stochasticity in SVRP and utilizes an RL agent with
  a simple yet effective architecture and a tailored training method. Through comparative
  analysis, our proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to a widely
  adopted state-of-the-art metaheuristic, achieving a significant 3.43% reduction
  in travel costs. Furthermore, the model exhibits robustness across diverse SVRP
  settings, highlighting its adaptability and ability to learn optimal routing strategies
  in varying environments. The publicly available implementation of our framework
  serves as a valuable resource for future research endeavors aimed at advancing RL-based
  solutions for SVRP.
