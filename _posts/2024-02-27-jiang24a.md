abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) have received increasing interest as a
  major methodology for explaining neural network classifiers. Usually, CEs for an
  input-output pair are defined as data points with minimum distance to the input
  that are classified with a different label than the output. To tackle the established
  problem that CEs are easily invalidated when model parameters are updated (e.g.
  retrained), studies have proposed ways to certify the robustness of CEs under model
  parameter changes bounded by a norm ball. However, existing methods targeting this
  form of robustness are not sound or complete, and they may generate implausible
  CEs, i.e., outliers wrt the training dataset. In fact, no existing method simultaneously
  optimises for closeness and plausibility while preserving robustness guarantees.
  In this work, we propose Provably RObust and PLAusible Counterfactual Explanations
  (PROPLACE), a method leveraging on robust optimisation techniques to address the
  aforementioned limitations in the literature. We formulate an iterative algorithm
  to compute provably robust CEs and prove its convergence, soundness and completeness.
  Through a comparative experiment involving six baselines, five of which target robustness,
  we show that PROPLACE achieves state-of-the-art performances against metrics on
  three evaluation aspects.
