abstract: We study regret minimization in an average-reward and communicating Markov
  Decision Process (MDP) with known dynamics, but unknown reward function. Although
  learning in such MDPs is a priori easier than in fully unknown ones, they are still
  largely challenging as they include as special cases large classes of problems such
  as combinatorial semi-bandits. Leveraging the knowledge on transition function in
  regret minimization, in a statistically efficient way, appears largely unexplored.
  As it is conjectured that achieving exact optimality in generic MDPs is NP-hard,
  even with known transitions, we focus on a computationally efficient relaxation,
  at the cost of achieving order-optimal logarithmic regret instead of exact optimality.
  We contribute to filling this gap by introducing a novel algorithm based on the
  popular Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence strategy for bandits. A key component
  of the proposed algorithm is a carefully designed stopping criterion leveraging
  the recurrent classes induced by stationary policies. We derive a non-asymptotic,
  problem-dependent, and logarithmic regret bound for this algorithm, which relies
  on a novel regret decomposition leveraging the structure. We further provide an
  efficient implementation and experiments illustrating its promising empirical performance.
