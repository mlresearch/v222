abstract: Graph classification is a crucial task in the field of graph learning with
  numerous practical applications. Typically, the first step is to construct vertex
  features by the statistical information of the graph. Existing graph neural networks
  often adopt the one-hot degree encoding strategy to construct vertex features. Then,
  these features are fed into a linear layer, which outputs a low-dimensional real
  vector serving as the initial vertex representation for the graph model. However,
  the conventional approach of constructing vertex features may not be optimal. Intuitively,
  the method of constructing vertex features can have significant impact on the effectiveness
  of model. Hence, the construction of informative vertex features from the graph
  and the design of an efficient graph model to process these features pose great
  challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel method for constructing hierarchical
  topology vertex features and designing a hybrid convolution method to handle these
  features. Experimental results on public graph datasets of Social Networks, Small
  Molecules, and Bioinformatics demonstrate the superior performance of our method
  compared to baselines.
