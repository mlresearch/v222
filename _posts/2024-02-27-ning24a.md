abstract: Tiny object detection has gained considerable attention in the research
  community owing to the frequent occurrence of tiny objects in numerous critical
  real-world scenarios. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used as the
  backbone for object detection architectures typically neglect Nyquistâ€™s sampling
  theorem during down-sampling operations, resulting in aliasing and degraded performance.
  This is likely to be a particular issue for tiny objects that occupy very few pixels
  and therefore have high spatial frequency features. This paper applied an existing
  approach WaveCNet for anti-aliasing to tiny object detection. WaveCNet addresses
  aliasing by replacing standard down-sampling processes in CNNs with Wavelet Pooling
  (WaveletPool) layers, effectively suppressing aliasing. We modify the original WaveCNet
  to apply WaveletPool in a consistent way in both pathways of the residual blocks
  in ResNets. Additionally, we also propose a bottom-heavy version of the backbone,
  which further improves the performance of tiny object detection while also reducing
  the required number of parameters by almost half. Experimental results on the TinyPerson,
  WiderFace, and DOTA datasets demonstrate the importance of anti-aliasing in tiny
  object detection and the effectiveness of the proposed method which achieves new
  state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Codes and experiment results are
  released at \url{https://github.com/freshn/Anti-aliasing-Tiny-Object-Detection.git}.
