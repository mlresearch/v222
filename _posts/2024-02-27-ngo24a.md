abstract: A common problem encountered in many real-world applications is level set
  estimation where the goal is to determine the region in the function domain where
  the function is above or below a given threshold. When the function is black-box
  and expensive to evaluate, the level sets need to be found in a minimum set of function
  evaluations. Existing methods often assume a discrete search space with a finite
  set of data points for function evaluations and estimating the level sets. When
  applied to a continuous search space, these methods often need to first discretize
  the space which leads to poor results while needing high computational time. While
  some methods cater for the continuous setting, they still lack a proper guarantee
  for theoretical convergence. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm
  that does not need any discretization and can directly work in continuous search
  spaces. Our method suggests points by constructing an acquisition function that
  is defined as a measure of confidence of the function being higher or lower than
  the given threshold. A theoretical analysis for the convergence of the algorithm
  to an accurate solution is provided. On multiple synthetic and real-world datasets,
  our algorithm successfully outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
