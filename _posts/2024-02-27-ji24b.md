abstract: In this work, we study kernel regression that integrates with a modern deep
  neural network (DNN). The DNN projects the input into an embedding space, meanwhile
  a set of representative points is constructed in this embedding space. We build
  the regression using a finite set of kernels defined on the embedding space, where
  the DNN weights, the regression coefficients, and kernel hyperparameters are all
  learnable. We extend the model by introducing a location attention strategy and
  the multiple kernel technique. We provide effective ways to obtain representative
  points. The proposed model can be trained with an end-to-end learning algorithm
  with simple implementation. Simulation studies show that the proposed deep kernel
  regression is well scalable to large datasets and comparable to or superior to recent
  deep kernel models in various regression problems.
