abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance, but end-users
  do not understand how the system solves tasks due to the black-box nature of neural
  networks. Many methods from explainable machine learning have been adapted to RL.
  However, they do not focus on the unique challenges of explaining actions’ short-term
  and long-term consequences. This work introduces a new perspective to understanding
  RL policies by clustering states into abstract states utilizing attention maps,
  giving a bird’s-eye view of the policy’s behavior. We learn the attention maps iteratively
  together with the clustering of states by masking the input features to estimate
  their importance. In contrast to previous works that have uninterpretable abstract
  states and/or clustering objectives using state values that are non-human intuitive,
  we only leverage attention maps in the clustering. The policy only indirectly affects
  the clustering via attention maps. This allows us to give global explanations from
  the view of feature attention, a quantity a human can relate to given interpretable
  features. The experiments demonstrate that our method provides faithful abstractions
  by capturing state semantics, policy behavior, and feature attention. Furthermore,
  we show that our attention maps can mask state features without affecting policy
  performance.
