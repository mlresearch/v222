abstract: Our research demonstrates the significant benefits of using fine-tuning
  with explanations to enhance the performance of language models. Unlike prompting,
  which maintains the model’s parameters, fine-tuning allows the model to learn and
  update its parameters during a training phase. In this study, we applied fine-tuning
  to various sized language models using data that contained explanations of the output
  rather than merely presenting the answers. We found that even smaller language models
  with as few as 60 million parameters benefited substantially from this approach.
  Interestingly, our results indicated that the detailed explanations were more beneficial
  to smaller models than larger ones, with the latter gaining nearly the same advantage
  from any form of explanation, irrespective of its length. Additionally, we demonstrate
  that the inclusion of explanations enables the models to solve tasks that they were
  not able to solve without explanations. Lastly, we argue that despite the challenging
  nature of adding explanations, samples that contain explanations not only reduce
  the volume of data required for training but also promote a more effective generalization
  by the model. In essence, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with explanations
  significantly bolsters the performance of large language models.
