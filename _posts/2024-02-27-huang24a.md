abstract: 'Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to train an
  action instance localization model from untrimmed videos with only video-level labels,
  similar to the Object Detection (OD) task. Existing Top-k MIL-based WSTAL methods
  cannot flexibly define the learning space, which limits the modelâ€™s learning efficiency
  and performance. Faster R-CNN is a classic two-stage object detection architecture
  with an efficient Region Proposal Network. This paper successfully migrates the
  Faster R-CNN liked two-stage architecture to the WSTAL task: first to build a T-RPN
  and integrate it with the traditional WSTAL framework; and then to propose a pseudo
  label generation mechanism to enable the T-RPN learning without temporal annotations.
  Our new framework has achieved breakthrough performances on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.2
  datasets, and comprehensive ablation experiments have verified the effectiveness
  of the innovations. Code will be available at: \href{https://github.com/ZJUHJ/TRPN}{https://github.com/ZJUHJ/TRPN}.'
