abstract: We present a novel approach, Equilibrium Point Learning (EPL), for training
  the deep equilibrium model (DEQ). In this method, the equilibrium point of the DEQ
  serves as the learnable parameters. Notably, the DEQ parameters encapsulate the
  learning algorithm itself and remain fixed. Consequently, by exploring the parameter
  space, we can discover a more efficient learning algorithm without relying on conventional
  techniques such as backpropagation or Q-learning. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary
  approach inspired by biological neurons to evolve the DEQ model parameters. Initially,
  we examine the physical dynamics of neurons at the molecular level and translate
  them into a dynamical system representation. Subsequently, we formulate a deep implicit
  layer that is mathematically proven to possess an equilibrium point. The energy
  function of the implicit layer is defined using a quadratic form augmented with
  entropy and momentum terms. Given the resemblance between the dynamics of the deep
  implicit layer and the principles of physics and chemistry, it can effectively capture
  the biomodel of systems biology and the neural model of spiking neural networks
  (SNNs). This equivalence enables us to define the implicit layer of the DEQ, allowing
  for seamless integration with existing artificial neural networks (ANNs). Finally,
  we employ HyperNEAT to evolve the parameters of the dynamical system. Through our
  experiments, we observe a consistent improvement in learning efficiency, with each
  successive generation exhibiting a 0.2% increase in learning speed per generation.
