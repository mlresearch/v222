abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) are commonly
  encountered in everyday life. However, finding the optimal solution through traditional
  exact and heuristic algorithms can be time-consuming due to its NP-hard nature.
  Fortunately, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in solving complex
  combinatorial optimization problems (COP). In this paper, we introduce a new Multi-objective
  Adaptive Dynamics Attention Model (MOADAM) that aims to better approximate the whole
  Pareto set. We modify the encoder and decoder of the model to better utilize dynamic
  information, and we also design a new weight sampling method to improve the modelâ€™s
  performance for extreme solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
  proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of solution
  quality on multi-objective vehicle routing problems with capacity constraints (MOCVRP).
