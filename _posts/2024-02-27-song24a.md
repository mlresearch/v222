abstract: 'This paper tackles the critical challenge of object navigation in autonomous
  navigation systems, particularly focusing on the problem of target approach and
  episode termination in environments with long optimal episode length in Deep Reinforcement
  Learning (DRL) based methods. While effective in environment exploration and object
  localization, conventional DRL methods often struggle with optimal path planning
  and termination recognition due to a lack of depth information. To overcome these
  limitations, we propose a novel approach, namely the Depth-Inference Termination
  Agent (DITA), which incorporates a supervised model called the Judge Model to implicitly
  infer object-wise depth and decide termination jointly with reinforcement learning.
  We train our judge model along with reinforcement learning in parallel and supervise
  the former efficiently by reward signal. Our evaluation shows the method is demonstrating
  superior performance, we achieve a 9.3% gain on success rate than our baseline method
  across all room types and gain 51.2% improvements on long episodes environment while
  maintaining slightly better Success Weighted by Path Length (SPL). Code and resources,
