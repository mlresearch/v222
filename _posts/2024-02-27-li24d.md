abstract: Learning latent representations of nodes in graphs is important for many
  real-world applications, such as recommender systems, traffic prediction and fraud
  detection. Most of the existing research on graph representation learning has focused
  on static graphs. However, many real-world graphs are dynamic and their structures
  change over time, which makes learning dynamic node representations challenging.
  We propose a novel k-truss based temporal graph convolutional network named TTGCN
  to learn potential node representations on dynamic graphs. Specifically, TTGCN utilizes
  a novel truss-based graph convolutional layer named TrussGCN to capture the topology
  and hierarchical structure information of graphs, and combines it with a temporal
  evolution module to capture complex temporal dependencies. We conduct link prediction
  experiments on five different dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
  the superiority of TTGCN for dynamic graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms
  several state-of-the-art baselines in the link prediction task. In addition, our
  ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of adopting TrussGCN in a dynamic
  graph embedding method.
