abstract: In the task of Hierarchical Multi-label Text Classification (HTMC), there
  exist multiple multivariate relations between labels, particularly the semantic
  dependencies within label branches of the hierarchy. However, existing methods struggle
  to fully exploit these potential multivariate dependencies since they can only model
  binary relationships at best. In this paper, we address this limitation by focusing
  on leveraging semantic dependencies among labels within branches and propose a Hyper-Label-Graph
  Model (HLGM). Specifically, we first construct a label hypergraph based on the taxonomy
  hierarchy and utilize a hypergraph attention mechanism to learn branch-level multivariate
  dependencies among labels. Furthermore, the model employs a label-text fusion module
  to generate label-level text representations, facilitating the comprehensive integration
  of semantic features between text and labels. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
  triplet loss to enhance the ability to distinguish labels within the hyperedge structure.
  We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on three benchmark datasets,
  and the experimental results demonstrate that HLGM outperforms competitive GNN-based
  baselines.
