abstract: The discrete logarithm problem is a fundamental challenge in number theory
  with significant implications for cryptographic protocols. In this paper, we investigate
  the limitations of gradient-based methods for learning the parity bit of the discrete
  logarithm in finite cyclic groups of prime order. Our main result, supported by
  theoretical analysis and empirical verification, reveals the concentration of the
  gradient of the loss function around a fixed point, independent of the logarithm’s
  base used. This concentration property leads to a restricted ability to learn the
  parity bit efficiently using gradient-based methods, irrespective of the complexity
  of the network architecture being trained. Our proof relies on Boas-Bellman inequality
  in inner product spaces and it involves establishing approximate orthogonality of
  discrete logarithm’s parity bit functions through the spectral norm of certain matrices.
  Empirical experiments using a neural network-based approach further verify the limitations
  of gradient-based learning, demonstrating the decreasing success rate in predicting
  the parity bit as the group order increases.
