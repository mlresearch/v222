abstract: Regularization plays a crucial role in machine learning models, especially
  for deep neural networks. The existing regularization techniques mainly rely on
  the i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample, without
  the leverage of the neighboring relationship between samples. In this work, we propose
  a general regularizer called \textbf{Patch-level Neighborhood InterpolationÂ (Pani)}
  that conducts a non-local representation in the computation of networks. Our proposal
  explicitly constructs patch-level graphs in different layers and then linearly interpolates
  neighborhood patch features, serving as a general and effective regularization strategy.
  Further, we customize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods,
  namely Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The
  first derived \textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local adversarial
  smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The second derived
  \textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves superiority over MixUp
  and competitive performance over state-of-the-art variants of MixUp method with
  a significant advantage in computational efficiency. Extensive experiments have
  verified the effectiveness of our Pani approach in both supervised and semi-supervised
  settings.
