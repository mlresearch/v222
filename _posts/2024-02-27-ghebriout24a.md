abstract: The recent surge of interest surrounding Multimodal Neural Networks (MM-NN)
  is attributed to their ability to effectively process and integrate multiscale information
  from diverse data sources. MM-NNs extract and fuse features from multiple modalities
  using adequate unimodal backbones and specific fusion networks. Although this helps
  strengthen the multimodal information representation, designing such networks is
  labor-intensive. It requires tuning the architectural parameters of the unimodal
  backbones, choosing the fusing point, and selecting the operations for fusion. Furthermore,
  multimodality AI is emerging as a cutting-edge option in Internet of Things (IoT)
  systems where inference latency and energy consumption are critical metrics in addition
  to accuracy. In this paper, we propose \textit{Harmonic-NAS}, a framework for the
  joint optimization of unimodal backbones and multimodal fusion networks with hardware
  awareness on resource-constrained devices. \textit{Harmonic-NAS} involves a two-tier
  optimization approach for the unimodal backbone architectures and fusion strategy
  and operators. By incorporating the hardware dimension into the optimization, evaluation
  results on various devices and multimodal datasets have demonstrated the superiority
  of \textit{Harmonic-NAS} over state-of-the-art approaches achieving up to $\sim
  \textbf{10.9%} accuracy improvement, $\sim$\textbf{1.91x} latency reduction, and
  $\sim$\textbf{2.14x} energy efficiency gain.
