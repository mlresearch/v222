abstract: The salp swarm algorithm(SSA) has been successfully used to solve the feature
  selection problem due to its fast convergence and simple structure. However, existing
  SSA-based methods still suffer from the issue of low classification accuracy due
  to the problem of getting trapped in local optima. Therefore, this paper proposes
  a novel feature selection method for classification based on SSA, which can continuously
  generate new sub-populations to improve the search environment of the main population.
  Specifically, a flip-prohibition(F-P) operator is first proposed to help the main
  population, which may currently fall into a local optimum, find a new and more promising
  region. A multi-surrogate technique is suggested to evaluate the region to determine
  the position of sub-populations, which can reduce the high computational cost. In
  addition, a population initialization method is developed according to the importance
  of features and the dimensionality of the dataset. Finally, a communication mechanism
  is presented to enable different sub-populations to learn from each other. By comparing
  the proposed method with other 6 feature selection methods on 16 datasets, we demonstrate
  that the proposed method has better classification ability and can select a smaller
  feature subset in most cases.
