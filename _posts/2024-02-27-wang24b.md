abstract: With the advancement of deep learning techniques, image restoration (IR)
  performance has improved significantly. However, these techniques often come with
  high computational costs, which pose challenges in meeting the processing latency
  requirements of resource-constrained hardware in edge computer vision systems. To
  address this issue, we propose a simple binarization technique and an efficient
  training strategy called Gentle Approximation Method (GAM) to extend the application
  of binary neural networks (BNNs) to various IR tasks, including low-light image
  enhancement, deraining, denoising, and super-resolution. Our results demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method in binarizing full-precision deep neural networks.
  By binarizing these networks, we achieve a significant reduction in computational
  and memory demands while maintaining satisfactory performance. For instance, in
  the denoising task, the FLOPs can be reduced to only 3% of the original network
  while preserving most of the performance.
