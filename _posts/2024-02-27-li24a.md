abstract: " In recent years, U-Net and its variants have been widely used in pathology
  image segmentation tasks. One of the key designs of U-Net is the use of skip connections
  between the encoder and decoder, which helps to recover detailed information after
  upsampling. While most variations of U-Net adopt the original skip connection design,
  there is semantic gap between the encoder and decoder that can negatively impact
  model performance. Therefore, it is important to reduce this semantic gap before
  conducting skip connection. To address this issue, we propose a new segmentation
  network called FusionU-Net, which is based on U-Net structure and incorporates a
  fusion module to exchange information between different skip connections to reduce
  semantic gaps. Unlike the other fusion modules in existing networks, ours is based
  on a two-round fusion design that fully considers the local relevance between adjacent
  encoder layer outputs and the need for bi-directional information exchange across
  multiple layers. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple pathology image
  datasets to evaluate our model and found that FusionU-Net achieves better performance
  compared to other competing methods. We argue our fusion module is more effective
  than the designs of existing networks, and it could be easily embedded into other
  networks to further enhance the model performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Zongyi-Lee/FusionU-Net"
