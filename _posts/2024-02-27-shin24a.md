abstract: 'With advancements in text-to-image (TTI) models, text-to-video (TTV) models
  have recently been introduced. Motivated by approaches on TTV models adapting from
  diffusion-based TTI models, we suggest the text-guided video editing framework given
  only a pretrained TTI model and a single <text, video> pair, which we term Edit-A-Video.
  The framework consists of two stages: (1) inflating the 2D model into the 3D model
  by appending temporal modules and tuning on the source video (2) inverting the source
  video into the noise and editing with target text through attention map injection.
  Each stage enables the temporal modeling and preservation of semantic attributes
  of the source video. One of the key challenges for video editing is a background
  inconsistency problem, where the regions unrelated to the edit suffer from undesirable
  and inconsistent temporal alterations. To mitigate this issue, we also introduce
  a novel mask blending method, termed as temporal-consistent blending (TC Blending).
  We improve previous mask blending methods to reflect the temporal consistency, ensuring
  that the area where the editing is applied exhibits smooth transition while also
  achieving spatio-temporal consistency of the unedited regions. We present extensive
  experimental results over various types of text and videos, and demonstrate the
  superiority of the proposed method compared to baselines in terms of background
  consistency, text alignment, and video editing quality. Our samples are available
  on https://editavideo.github.io.'
