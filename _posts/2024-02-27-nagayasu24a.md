abstract: Since the success of Residual Network(ResNet), many of architectures of
  Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have adopted skip connection. While the generalization
  performance of CNN with skip connection has been explained within the framework
  of Ensemble Learning, the dependency on the number of parameters has not been revealed.
  In this paper, we show that Bayesian free energy of Convolutional Neural Network
  both with and without skip connection in Bayesian learning. Bayesian Free Energy
  is the negative log marginal likelihood which is equivalent to Stochastic Complexity
  or Minimum Description Length (MDL) used for evaluating model complexity. The upper
  bound of free energy of Bayesian CNN with skip connection does not depend on the
  oveparametrization and, the generalization error of Bayesian CNN has similar property.
