abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called Adaptive Behavioral Costs
  in Reinforcement Learning (ABC-RL) for training a human-like agent with competitive
  strength. While deep reinforcement learning agents have recently achieved superhuman
  performance in various video games, some of these unconstrained agents may exhibit
  actions, such as shaking and spinning, that are not typically observed in human
  behavior, resulting in peculiar gameplay experiences. To behave like humans and
  retain similar performance, ABC-RL augments behavioral limitations as cost signals
  in reinforcement learning with dynamically adjusted weights. Unlike traditional
  constrained policy optimization, we propose a new formulation that minimizes the
  behavioral costs subject to a constraint of the value function. By leveraging the
  augmented Lagrangian, our approach is an approximation of the Lagrangian adjustment,
  which handles the trade-off between the performance and the human-like behavior.
  Through experiments conducted on 3D games in DMLab-30 and Unity ML-Agents Toolkit,
  we demonstrate that ABC-RL achieves the same performance level while significantly
  reducing instances of shaking and spinning. These findings underscore the effectiveness
  of our proposed approach in promoting more natural and human-like behavior during
  gameplay.
