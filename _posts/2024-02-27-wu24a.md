abstract: Aspect-based-sentiment-analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment evaluation
  task, which analyzes the emotional polarity of the evaluation aspects. Generally,
  the emotional polarity of an aspect exists in the corresponding opinion expression,
  whose diversity has great impact on modelâ€™s performance. To mitigate this problem,
  we propose a novel and simple counterfactual data augmentation method to generate
  opinion expressions with reversed sentiment polarity. In particular, the integrated
  gradients are calculated to locate and mask the opinion expression. Then, a prompt
  combined with the reverse expression polarity is added to the original text, and
  a Pre-trained language model (PLM), T5, is finally was employed to predict the masks.
  The experimental results shows the proposed counterfactual data augmentation method
  performs better than current augmentation methods on three ABSA datasets, i.e. Laptop,
  Restaurant, and MAMS.
