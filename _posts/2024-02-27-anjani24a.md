abstract: Trees play a very important role in maintaining the ecosystem. To automate
  the process of extracting trees from Remote Sensing data and counting thereby, we
  have used Cartosat-2S merged products @ 0.6m as input. Vegetation indices such as
  NDVI, and EVI can retrieve the Vegetation class which contains trees and their look-alikes
  (such as grass, fields, and shrubs) having the same spectral signatures \em{i.e.},
  high reflectance in NIR band, and high absorption in Red band. Extraction of only
  Trees is not possible with these indices. In this paper we present a novel method
  for tree delineation from its look-alikes using AIML, concentrating more on preparation
  of input datasets efficiently. Based on the Spectral Separability analysis, only
  Red and NIR bands from the satellite imagery are utilized in the proposed method
  to separate Vegetation from the background classes (such as water, bare soil, terrain,
  and built-up). In addition to the two bands from satellite imagery entropy layer
  is computed from the NIR band and utilized as the third band to delineate trees
  from their look-alikes. Deep Neural Networks have the capability of learning complex
  patterns that can separate trees and their look-alikes. However, the performance
  is boosted when the entropy layer is added to the input image. The proposed method
  showed better performance when utilizing 3 bands Red, NIR, and Entropy bands compared
  to 4 bands i.e. Red, Green, Blue, and NIR bands. The proposed method obtains a precision
  of 96%, a recall of 90%, and an F1-score of 93% even with a relatively smaller training
  dataset. The study is performed on the data collected from various locations of
  the Indian state Rajasthan.
