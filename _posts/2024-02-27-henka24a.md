abstract: In response to the challenge of representing data from multiple sources,
  researchers have proposed the use of multiplex graphs as a solution. Multiplex graphs
  are particularly useful for representing multi-view data, where each layer represents
  a specific type of interaction. Pillar community detection of multiplex graphs is
  a clustering application that computes groups of vertices across all layers. Modularity
  maximization is a popular technique for graph clustering, which has been generalized
  to multiplex graphs. However, this generalization did not consider the importance
  of each layer in pillar clustering. This paper presents a new technique called Self
  Weighted Multiplex Modularity (SWMM), which optimizes the weights associated with
  each layer and the partition that maximizes the multiplex modularity. The paper
  proposes two optimization methods, iterative and direct, and demonstrates the effectiveness
  and robustness of the technique in accurately retrieving clusters even when data
  is highly missing.
