abstract: 'Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a leading cause of sudden
  cardiac death in young people. Septal myectomy surgery has been recognized as the
  gold standard for non-pharmacological therapy of HOCM, in which aortic and mitral
  valves are critical regions for surgical planning.Currently, manual segmentation
  of aortic and mitral valves is widely performed in clinical practice to construct
  3D models used for HOCM surgical planning. Such a process, however, is time-consuming
  and costly. In this paper, we integrate anatomical prior knowledge into deep learning
  for automatic segmentation of aortic and mitral valves.In particular, a two-stage
  method is proposed: we first obtain the region of interest (RoI) from a CT image,
  where heart segmentation is then performed. The spatial relationship between heart
  substructures is utilized to identify a valve region that contains the aortic and
  mitral valves. Unlike typical two-stage methods, we feed the refined segmentation
  of the left ventricle, left atrium, and aorta as additional input for the valve
  segmentation. By incorporating this anatomical prior knowledge, deep neural networks
  (DNNs) can leverage the surrounding anatomical structures to improve valve segmentation.
  We collected a dataset of 27 CT images from patients with a medical history of septal
  myectomy surgery.Experimental results show that our method achieves an average Dice
  score of 71.2% and an improvement of 4.2% over existing methods.'
