abstract: Alzheimer disease is one of the most common neuro-degenerative diseases,
  with an estimated 6.2 million cases in the United States. This research article
  investigates the potential of Transformer-based deep learning techniques to accelerate
  the processing of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures and improve the early
  diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) using sparse data. Diffusion Weighted Imaging
  (DWI) is a time-consuming process, with each diffusion direction taking between
  2-5 minutes, and at least 40 diffusion directions are needed for routine clinical
  diagnosis, which needs scanning duration exceeding 3 hours for each patient. By
  leveraging the attention mechanism, our proposed model generates quantitative measures
  of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AxD), and mean diffusivity (MD)
  using 5 and 21 diffusion directions, making it useful for clinical diagnosis through
  reduced scanning time of more than half. Our experimental results on the Alzheimer’s
  Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed model
  outperforms the traditional linear least square method, achieving accurate quantitative
  measurement of FA, AxD, and MD scores for early diagnosis of AD patients from healthy
  controls using sparse diffusion directions. Our analysis highlights the potential
  of Swin-Transformer attention-based deep learning framework to improve the early
  diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
