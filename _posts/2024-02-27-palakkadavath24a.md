abstract: Domain generalization (DG) uses multiple source (training) domains to learn
  a model that generalizes well to unseen domains. Existing approaches to DG need
  more scrutiny over (i) the ability to imagine data beyond the source domains and
  (ii) the ability to cope with the scarcity of training data. To address these shortcomings,
  we propose a novel framework - \emph{interpolation robustness}, where we view each
  training domain as a point on a domain manifold and learn class-specific representations
  that are domain invariant across all interpolations between domains. We use this
  representation to propose a generic domain generalization approach that can be seamlessly
  combined with many state-of-the-art methods in DG. Through extensive experiments,
  we show that our approach can enhance the performance of several methods in the
  conventional and the limited training data setting.
