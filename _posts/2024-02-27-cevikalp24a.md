abstract: This study introduces a new approach for open set recognition, wherein we
  propose a novel method utilizing uniformly distributed centers on a hypersphere.
  Each class in the proposed method is represented by a center, and these centers
  and features of the deep learning architecture are jointly learned from the training
  data in an end-to-end fashion. We ensure that the centers lie on the boundary of
  a hypersphere whose center is positioned at the origin. The class-specific samples
  are compelled by the proposed loss function to be closer to their respective centers.
  In open set recognition scenarios, an additional loss term is employed to separate
  the background samples from the known class centers. The assignment of test samples
  to classes is based on the Euclidean distances calculated from the learned class
  centers. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields the state-of-the-art
  accuracies on open set recognition datasets.
