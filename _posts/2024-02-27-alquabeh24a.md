abstract: Pairwise learning is essential in machine learning, especially for problems
  involving loss functions defined on pairs of training examples. Online gradient
  descent (OGD) algorithms have been proposed to handle online pairwise learning,
  where data arrives sequentially. However, the pairwise nature of the problem makes
  scalability challenging, as the gradient computation for a new sample involves all
  past samples. Recent advancements in OGD algorithms have aimed to reduce the complexity
  of calculating online gradients, achieving complexities less than $O(T)$ and even
  as low as $O(1)$. However, these approaches are primarily limited to linear models
  and have induced variance. In this study, we propose a limited memory OGD algorithm
  that extends to kernel online pairwise learning while improving the sublinear regret.
  Specifically, we establish a clear connection between the variance of online gradients
  and the regret, and construct online gradients using the most recent stratified
  samples with a limited buffer of size of $s$ representing all past data, which have
  a complexity of $O(sT)$ and employs $O(\sqrt{T}\log{T})$ random Fourier features
  for kernel approximation. Importantly, our theoretical results demonstrate that
  the variance-reduced online gradients lead to an improved sublinear regret bound.
  The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm
  over both kernelized and linear online pairwise learning algorithms.The code is
