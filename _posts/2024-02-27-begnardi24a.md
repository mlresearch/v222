abstract: 'As a growing number of warehouse operators are moving from human-only to
  Collaborative human-robot Order Picking solutions, more efficient picker routing
  policies are needed, since the complexity of coordinating multiple actors in the
  system increases significantly. The objective of these policies is to match human
  pickers and robot carriers to fulfill picking tasks, optimizing pick-rate and total
  tardiness of the orders. In this paper, we propose to formulate the order picking
  routing problem as a more general combinatorial optimization problem known as Two-sided
  Online Bipartite Matching. We present an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning
  approach to optimize a combination of pick-rate and order tardiness, and to deal
  with the uncertainty of real-world warehouse environments. To extract and exploit
  spatial information from the environment, we devise three different Graph Neural
  Network architectures and empirically evaluate them on several scenarios of growing
  complexity in a simulation environment we developed. We show that all proposed methods
  significantly outperform greedy and more sophisticated heuristics, as well as non-GNN-based
  DRL approaches. Moreover, our methods exhibit good transferability properties, even
  when scaling up test problem instances to more than forty times the size of the
  ones the models were trained on. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/lbegnardi/DRL-TOBM-CPR}.'
