abstract: Probabilistic modelling on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) within
  the Bayesian framework has shown success in estimating the complex distribution
  in literature. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian formulation for unsupervised
  and semi-supervised GAN learning. Specifically, we propose Folded Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo (F-HMC) methods within this framework to learn the distributions over the
  parameters of the generators and discriminators. We show that the F-HMC efficiently
  approximates multi-modal and high dimensional data when combined with Bayesian GANs.
  Its composition improves run time and test error in generating diverse samples.
  Experimental results with high-dimensional synthetic multi-modal data and natural
  image benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet, show that F-HMC outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods in terms of test error, run times per epoch, inception
  score and Frechet Inception Distance scores.
