abstract: Wildfires pose a significant and recurring challenge in North America, impacting
  both human and natural environments. The size and severity of wildfires in the region
  have been increasing in recent years, making it a pressing concern for communities,
  ecosystems, and the economy. The accurate and timely detection of active wildfires
  in remote areas is crucial for effective wildfire management and mitigation efforts.
  In this research paper, we propose a robust approach for detecting active wildfires
  using multispectral satellite imagery by leveraging vision transformers and a vast
  repository of landsat-$8$ satellite data with a $30$m spatial resolution in North
  America. Our methodology involves experimenting with vision transformers and deep
  convolutional neural networks for wildfire detection in multispectral satellite
  images. We compare the capabilities of these two architecture families in detecting
  wildfires within the multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, we propose a
  novel u-shape vision transformer that effectively captures spatial dependencies
  and learns meaningful representations from multispectral images, enabling precise
  discrimination between wildfire and non-wildfire regions. To evaluate the performance
  of our approach, we conducted experiments on a comprehensive dataset of wildfire
  incidents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately
  detecting active wildfires with an \textit{Dice Score or F$1$} of $%90.05$ and \textit{Recall}
  of $%89.61$ . Overall, our research presents a promising approach for leveraging
  vision transformers for multispectral satellite imagery to detect remote wildfires.
