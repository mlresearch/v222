abstract: Multi-behavior session-based recommendation (MBSBR) is a critical task in
  e-commerce and online advertising. By modeling these multiple behaviors, models
  can better capture the user intent and make more effective recommendations. However,
  existing models face the challenge of incompletely differentiating between different
  behavior types, which hinders their ability to fully capture the different tendencies
  exhibited by each behavior. In addition, most existing multi-behavior methods focus
  only on predicting a single target behavior and fail to achieve a unified model
  for predicting the next user-item interaction across multiple behavior types. To
  address these limitations, we introduce reinforcement learning to the multi-behavior
  session-based recommendation task and propose a novel approach called the multi-behavior
  graph reinforcement learning network (MB-GRL). Specifically, we use a graph neural
  network to encode item transition information from the session graph. Then, we use
  an attention network to obtain a session representation and generate recommendations
  based on it. At the same time, we also apply Deep Q-Network (DQN) as a regularizer
  to improve the recommendation performance for certain behavior types. Experiments
  on various public benchmark datasets show that MB-GRL outperforms other models for
  multi-behavior session-based recommendation.
