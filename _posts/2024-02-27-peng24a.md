abstract: 'Utilizing a pretrained vision backbone to finetune a model for semantic
  segmentation is common practice in computer vision. However, there are few works
  intending to enlarge the semantic context learning capacity by incorporating a segmentation
  adapter into the backbone. Thus, in this paper, we present a simple but efficient
  segmentation adapter, termed as SegAdapter, which can be plugged into the pretrained
  vision backbone to improve the performance of existing models for image semantic
  segmentation. We summarize SegAdapter with three attractive advantages: 1) SegAdapter
  is a plug-and-play module demonstrating strong adaptability in CNN and Transformer
  based models such as ConvNext and Segformer, 2) SegAdapter applies a light-weight
  High-order Spatial Attention (HSA) to make use of intermediate features from the
  pretrained backbone which extends the model depth and produces auxiliary segmentation
  maps for model enhancement, 3) SegAdapter builds a powerful vision backbone by incorporating
  the semantic context into each stage which takes on some of the functions of the
  segmentation head. So, SegAdapter augmented model can be used in simple designed
  decode head to avoid heavy computational cost. By plugging multiple SegAdapter layers
  into different vision backbones, we construct a series of SegAdapter-based segmentation
  models. We show through the extensive experiments that SegAdapter can be used with
  mainstream backbones like CNN and Transformer to improve mIoU performance in a large
  margin while introducing minimal additional parameters and FLOPs.'
