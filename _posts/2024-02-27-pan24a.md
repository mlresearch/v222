abstract: Cervical cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, and in clinical
  practice, cervical cancer is best treated if it is detected at an early stage. Thinprep
  Cytologic Test (TCT) is the best early detection method for cervical cancer as determined
  by the WHO. As the coverage of early detection of cervical cancer increases, the
  number of samples in hospitals increases annually, and the pressure on the pathologists
  to read the cytological images increases, which easily leads to an increase in the
  rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Therefore, automatic detection of abnormal
  cells in cervical cytology images of cervical fluid using deep learning techniques
  has become a hot research topic today. However, existing deep learning models for
  cell detection often collect a single data source from a medical institution for
  construction. Different medical institutions have different equipment and staining
  methods, and the accuracy, magnification, and staining results of the images obtained
  will be different. As a result, the application performance of the model in different
  medical institution data is not good, and there is a problem of domain shift. To
  address these problems, this paper proposes a method for cervical fluid-based cell
  detection based on causal feature extraction. The method is based on the one-stage
  detection model RetinaNet, and incorporates causal autoencoder to learn the invariant
  causal feature representation from data. It reduces the impact of task-irrelevant
  feature representations, reduces the variability of feature distributions in different
  datasets, and effectively solves the domain shift problem. The addition of deformable
  convolution and attention mechanism enhances the feature extraction capability for
  foreground categories with variable shapes in cervical fluid-based pathology images.
  This reduces the impact of possible strong correlation between background features
  and goal cells, and reduces the interference of the foreground categories by fading
  and lack of brightness in the staining. The generalization ability of the model
  is improved, which makes the model better applicable to different medical institutions.
  The experimental results show that the method in this paper not only improves the
  accuracy of the model detection, but also verifies its good generalization effect
  on different datasets.
