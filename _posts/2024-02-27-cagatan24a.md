abstract: This paper introduces BarlowRL, a data-efficient reinforcement learning
  agent that combines the Barlow Twins self-supervised learning framework with DER
  (Data-Efficient Rainbow) algorithm. BarlowRL outperforms both DER and its contrastive
  counterpart CURL on the Atari 100k benchmark. BarlowRL avoids dimensional collapse
  by enforcing information spread to the whole space. This helps RL algorithms to
  utilize uniformly spread state representation that eventually results in a remarkable
  performance. The integration of Barlow Twins with DER enhances data efficiency and
  achieves superior performance in the RL tasks. BarlowRL demonstrates the potential
  of incorporating self-supervised learning techniques to improve RL algorithms.
