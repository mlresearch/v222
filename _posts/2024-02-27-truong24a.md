abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have promoted
  their use in almost every field. The growing complexity of deep neural networks
  (DNNs) makes it increasingly difficult and important to explain the inner workings
  and decisions of the network. However, most current techniques for explaining DNNs
  focus mainly on interpreting classification tasks. This paper proposes a method
  to explain the decision for any object detection model called D-CLOSE. To closely
  track the modelâ€™s behavior, we used multiple levels of segmentation on the image
  and a process to combine them. We performed tests on the MS-COCO dataset with the
  YOLOX model, which shows that our method outperforms D-RISE and can give a better
  quality and less noise explanation.
