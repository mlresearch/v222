abstract: Random feature model with a nonlinear activation function has been shown
  to perform asymptotically equivalent to a Gaussian model in terms of training and
  generalization errors. Analysis of the equivalent model reveals an important yet
  not fully understood role played by the activation function. To address this issue,
  we study the "parameters" of the equivalent model to achieve improved generalization
  performance for a given supervised learning problem. We show that acquired parameters
  from the Gaussian model enable us to define a set of optimal nonlinearities. We
  provide two example classes from this set, e.g., second-order polynomial and piecewise
  linear functions. These functions are optimized to improve generalization performance
  regardless of the actual form. We experiment with regression and classification
  problems, including synthetic and real (e.g., CIFAR10) data. Our numerical results
  validate that the optimized nonlinearities achieve better generalization performance
  than widely-used nonlinear functions such as ReLU. Furthermore, we illustrate that
  the proposed nonlinearities also mitigate the so-called double descent phenomenon,
  which is known as the non-monotonic generalization performance regarding the sample
  size and the model size.
