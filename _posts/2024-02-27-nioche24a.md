abstract: 'Mathematical models of observational phenomena are at the core of experimental
  sciences. By learning the parameters of such models from typically noisy observations,
  we can interpret and predict the phenomena under investigation. This process, however,
  assumes that the model itself is correct and that we are only uncertain of its parameters.
  In practice, this is rarely true, but rather the model is a simplification of the
  actual generative process. One proposed remedy is a post hoc investigation of how
  the model differs from reality, by explicitly modeling the discrepancy between the
  two. In this paper, we use transformed Gaussian processes as flexible models for
  this. Our formulation relaxes the assumption on the correctness of the model by
  assuming it is only correct in expectation, and it directly supports both additive
  and multiplicative corrections, treated separately in the literature, using suitable
  transformations. We demonstrate the approach in two example cases: modeling human
  growth (relation age-height) and modeling the risk attitude (relation reward-utility).
  The former provides a simple example, while the second case highlights the importance
  of the transformations in obtaining meaningful information about the discrepancy.'
