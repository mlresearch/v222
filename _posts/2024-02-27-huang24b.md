abstract: Traffic forecasting plays an extremely important role in many applications
  such as intelligent transportation and smart cities. However, due to the hidden
  and complex dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and heterogeneity, achieving high-precision
  traffic prediction is a challenging task. This paper proposes a new spatio-temporal
  aware learning graph neural network (STALGNN) for traffic prediction. First, a temporal-aware
  graph generation module is designed to exploit the spatial-temporal features that
  the spatial graph may not be able to present. Then, a spatio-temporal joint module
  is designed to more effectively capture local spatio-temporal correlations. Next,
  a multi-scale gated convolutions module is proposed to capture gloable dynamic spatio-temporal
  correlations. Furthermore, STALGNN further learns explicit  spatio-temporal correlations
  through integrated attention mechanisms and stacked graph convolutional networks
  to handle long-term prediction. Extensive experiments on several real traffic datasets
  show that the proposed method can achieve the superior performance compared with
  other baselines.
