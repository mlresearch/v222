abstract: Recent advances in manifold optimization for the Gaussian mixture model
  (GMM) have gained increasing interest. In this work, instead of directly addressing
  the manifold optimization on covariance matrices of GMM, we consider the GMM fitting
  as an optimization of the density function over a statistical manifold and seek
  the natural gradient to speed up the optimization process. We present an upper bound
  for the Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence between two GMMs and obtain simple closed-form
  expressions for the natural gradients. With the natural gradients, we then apply
  the Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) algorithm to optimize covariance
  matrices on a symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrix manifold. We further
  propose a Riemannian Adam (RAdam) algorithm that extends the momentum method and
  adaptive learning in the Euclidean space to the SPD manifold space. Extensive simulations
  show that the proposed algorithms scale well to high-dimensional large-scale datasets
  and outperform expectation maximization (EM) algorithms in fitted log-likelihood.
