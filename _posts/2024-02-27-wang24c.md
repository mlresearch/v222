abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation has long been recognized as an important
  theme in the online planning algorithms for POMDP problems. Explorative actions
  on one hand prevent the planning from falling into the suboptimal dilemma, while
  hindering the convergence of the planning procedure on the other hand. Therefore,
  it is meaningful to maintain the exploration as well as taking a step forward towards
  exploitation. Note that there is a deviation between the action selection criteria
  in the planning procedure and in the execution procedure, which inspires us to build
  a bridge between these two criteria to accelerate the convergence. A Partially Observable
  Monte Carlo Planning algorithm based on Path Modification (POMCP-PM) is presented
  in the paper, which modifies the backtracing paths by considering the two criteria
  simultaneously when updating the values of parent nodes. The algorithm is general
  as the Upper Confidence Bound Apply to Tree (UCT) algorithm used to select actions
  can be easily replaced by other criteria. Experimental results demonstrate that
  POMCP-PM outperforms POMCP with varying numbers of simulations on several scenarios
  with different scales.
