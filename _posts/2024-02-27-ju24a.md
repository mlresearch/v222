abstract: Attribute-aware face recognition has gained increasing attention in recent
  years due to its potential to improve the robustness of face recognition systems.
  However, this may raise concerns about potential biases and privacy issues. To alleviate
  this, some studies involve complex designs to obtain independent ID and attribute
  features and fuse them based on the application scenario (for better accuracy or
  fairness). In this paper, we obviate their complex design and demonstrate that the
  Nearest neighbours Proxy Triplet (NPT) loss has an intrinsic capability for feature
  disentanglement. To further enhance the effectiveness of NPT, we propose a novel
  margin-based loss, namely Adaptive-rank NPT, which naturally separates the identity
  and attribute features. While a margin-based loss ensures inter-class separability,
  it imposes no constraints on intra-class compactness. The samples that meet the
  inter-class margin will not contribute to network training. To mitigate this issue,
  we propose an adaptive distance measurement to promote the compactness of the learned
  features, resulting in the final Ada$^2$NPT loss. The experimental results obtained
  on several benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and merits of the proposed loss
  function over the state-of-the-art losses in terms of accuracy and fairness.
