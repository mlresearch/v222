abstract: Recent studies have shown that active object tracking algorithms based on
  deep reinforcement learning have the difficulty of model training while achieving
  favorable tracking outcomes. In addition, current active object tracking methods
  are not suitable for air-to-ground object tracking scenarios in high-altitude environments,
  such as air search and rescue. Therefore, we proposed a Knowledge-gUided Reinforcement
  learning (KURL) model for active object tracking, which includes two embedded knowledge-guided
  models (i.e., the state recognition model and the world model), together with a
  reinforcement learning module. The state recognition model utilizes the correlation
  between the observed states and image quality (as measured by object recognition
  probability) as prior knowledge to guide reinforcement learning algorithm to improve
  the observed image quality. The reinforcement learning module actively controls
  the Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera to achieve stable tracking. Additionally, a world
  model is proposed to replace the traditional Unreal Engine (UE) simulator for model
  training, which significantly enhancing the training efficiency (about ten times).
  The results indicate that the KURL model can significantly enhance the image quality,
  stability and robustness of tracking, compared with other methods in similar tasks.
