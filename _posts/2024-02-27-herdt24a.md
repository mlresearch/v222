abstract: In this work, we propose a fast and accurate method to reconstruct activations
  of classification and semantic segmentation networks by stitching them with a GAN
  generator utilizing a 1x1 convolution. We test our approach on images of animals
  from the AFHQ wild dataset, ImageNet1K, and real-world digital pathology scans of
  stained tissue samples. Our results show comparable performance to established gradient
  descent methods but with a processing time that is two orders of magnitude faster,
  making this approach promising for practical applications.
