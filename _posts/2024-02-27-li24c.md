abstract: Attributed graph clustering groups nodes into disjoint categories with graph
  convolutional networks and has exhibited promising performance in various applications.
  However, there are two issues preventing the performance from being improved  further.
  First, the relationships between distant nodes are generally overlooked due to the
  sparsity of graphs. Second, the graph convolutional networks with few layers are
  sensitive to noises. To address these issues, we propose Attributed Graph Subspace
  clustering with Graph-Boosting (AGSGB). Specifically, to deal with the first issue,
  an auxiliary graph is built from the feature matrix to establish the distant relationships.
  And to address the second issue, a subspace clustering module, famous for its robustness
  to noise, is introduced. Based on the auxiliary graph and the subspace clustering
  module, a graph enhance module and a graph refine module are constructed, together
  with the graph autoencoder constituting the final clustering model. By using the
  given graph and the refined graph built by the graph refine module, a dual guidance
  supervisor is designed to train the clustering model. Finally, the clustering result
  can be obtained by the subspace clustering module. Extensive experimental results
  on five public benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
