abstract: 'Multi-agent encirclement refers to controlling multiple agents to restrict
  the movement of a target and surround it with a specific formation. However, two
  challenges remain: encirclement in obstacle scenarios and encirclement of a faster
  target. In obstacle scenarios, we propose the utilization of obstacles for facilitating
  encirclement and introduce the concept of contributing angle to quantify the contribution
  of agents and obstacles, which enables agents to effectively utilize obstacles while
  mitigating the credit assignment problem. To address the challenge of encircling
  a faster target, we propose a two-stage encirclement method inspired by lionsâ€™ hunting
  strategy, effectively preventing target escape. We design the reward function based
  on the contributing angle and the lion encirclement method, integrating it with
  the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). The simulation results
  demonstrate that our method can utilize obstacles to complete encirclement and has
  a higher success rate. In some conditions with insufficient numbers of agents, our
  methods can still accomplish the task. Ablation experiments are conducted to verify
  the effectiveness of the contributing angle and the lion encirclement method respectively.'
