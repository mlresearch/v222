abstract: In semi-supervised learning, student-teacher distribution matching has been
  successful in improving performance of models using unlabeled data in conjunction
  with few labeled samples. In this paper, we aim to replicate that success in the
  self-supervised setup where we do not have access to any labeled data during pre-training.
  We introduce our algorithm, Q-Match, and show it is possible to induce the student-teacher
  distributions without any knowledge of downstream classes by using a queue of embeddings
  of samples from the unlabeled dataset. We focus our study on tabular datasets and
  show that Q-Match outperforms previous self-supervised learning techniques when
  measuring downstream classification performance. Furthermore, we show that our method
  is sample efficient–in terms of both the labels required for downstream training
  and the amount of unlabeled data required for pre-training–and scales well to the
  sizes of both the labeled and unlabeled data.
