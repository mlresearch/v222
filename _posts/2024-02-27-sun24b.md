abstract: Domain generalization is a popular machine learning technique that enables
  models to perform well on the unseen target domain, by learning from multiple source
  domains. Domain generalization is useful in cases where data is limited, difficult,
  or expensive to collect, such as in object recognition and biomedicine. In this
  paper, we propose a novel domain generalization algorithm called "meta-forests",
  which builds upon the basic random forests model by incorporating the meta-learning
  strategy and maximum mean discrepancy measure. The aim of meta-forests is to enhance
  the generalization ability of classifiers by reducing the correlation among trees
  and increasing their strength. More specifically, meta-forests conducts meta-learning
  optimization during each meta-task, while also utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy
  as a regularization term to penalize poor generalization performance in the meta-test
  process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we test it on two publicly
  object recognition datasets and a glucose monitoring dataset that we have used in
  a previous study. Our results show that meta-forests outperforms state-of-the-art
  approaches in terms of generalization performance on both object recognition and
  glucose monitoring datasets.
