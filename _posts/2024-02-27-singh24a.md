abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) is a prominent subfield of machine learning with
  extensive practical applications in learning visual similarities. However, DML systems
  are vulnerable to input distributions during inference that differ from the training
  data, such as adversarial examples (AXs). In this paper, we introduce MDProp, a
  framework that enhances the clean data performance and adversarial robustness of
  DML models by generating novel Multi-Targeted AXs and Unadversarial Examples, in
  addition to conventional single-targeted AXs, in the feature space. To handle the
  input distribution shift caused by the generated novel input distributions, MDProp
  scales the separate batch normalization layer strategy. Our comprehensive experimental
  analysis demonstrates that MDProp outperforms current state-of-the-art convolutional
  neural networks by up to 2.95% in terms of R@1 scores for clean data, while simultaneously
  improving adversarial robustness by up to 2.12 times. Additionally, MDProp achieves
  state-of-the-art results in data-scarce setting while utilizing only half of the
  training data. Implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/intherejeet/MDProp}.
