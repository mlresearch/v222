abstract: This paper studies the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem
  in the bandit framework in the canonical single-parameter exponential models. For
  this problem, many policies have been proposed, but most of them require solving
  an optimization problem at every round and/or are forced to explore an arm at least
  a certain number of times except those restricted to the Gaussian model. To address
  these limitations, we propose a novel policy that combines Thompson sampling with
  a computationally efficient approach known as the best challenger rule. While Thompson
  sampling was originally considered for maximizing the cumulative reward, we demonstrate
  that it can be used to naturally explore arms in BAI without forcing it. We show
  that our policy is asymptotically optimal for any two-armed bandit problems and
  achieves near optimality for general $K$-armed bandit problems for $K \geq 3$. Nevertheless,
  in numerical experiments, our policy shows competitive performance compared to asymptotically
  optimal policies in terms of sample complexity while requiring less computation
  cost. In addition, we highlight the advantages of our policy by comparing it to
  the concept of $\beta$-optimality, a relaxed notion of asymptotic optimality commonly
  considered in the analysis of a class of policies including the proposed one.
