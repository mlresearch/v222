abstract: In this work, we propose “Cell Variational Information Bottleneck Network
  (cellVIB)”, a convolutional neural network using information bottleneck mechanism,
  which can be combined with the latest feedforward network architecture in an end-to-end
  training method. Our Cell Variational Information Bottleneck Network is constructed
  by stacking VIB cells, which generate feature maps with uncertainty. As layers going
  deeper, the regularization effect will gradually increase, instead of directly adding
  excessive regular constraints to the output layer of the model as in Deep VIB. In
  each VIB cell, the feedforward process learns an independent mean term and a standard
  deviation term, and predicts the Gaussian distribution based on them. The feedback
  process is based on reparameterization trick for effective training. This work performs
  an extensive analysis on MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of each VIB cells
  mentioned above, and provides an insightful analysis on how the VIB cells affect
  mutual information. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 also prove that our network
  is robust against noisy labels during training and against corrupted images during
  testing. Then, we validate our method on PACS dataset, whose results show that the
  VIB cells can significantly improve the generalization performance of the basic
  model. Finally, in a more complex representation learning task, face recognition,
  our network structure has also achieved very competitive results.
