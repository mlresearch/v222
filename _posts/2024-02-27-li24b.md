abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning and its pervasive usage on various
  low-power and resource-constrained devices, model compression methods are increasingly
  used to reduce the model size and computation cost. Despite the overall high test
  accuracy of the compressed models, our observation shows that an original model
  and its compressed version (e.g., via quantization) can have deviated prediction
  outputs on the same inputs. These behavior deviations on compressed models are undesirable,
  given that the compressed models may be used in reliability-critical scenarios such
  as automated manufacturing and robotics systems. Inspired by software engineering
  practices, this paper proposes CompD, a differential testing (DT)-based framework
  for detecting and repairing prediction deviations on compressed models and their
  plaintext versions. CompD treats original/compressed models as “black-box,” thus
  offering an efficient method orthogonal to specific different compression schemes.
  Furthermore, CompD can leverage deviation-triggering inputs to finetune the compressed
  models, largely “repairing” their defects. Evaluations show that CompD can effectively
  test and repair common models compressed by different schemes.
