abstract: Prediction with the possibility of abstention (or selective prediction)
  is an important problem for error-critical machine learning applications. While
  well-studied in the classification setup, selective approaches to regression are
  much less developed. In this work, we consider the nonparametric heteroskedastic
  regression problem and develop an abstention procedure via testing the hypothesis
  on the value of the conditional variance at a given point. Unlike existing methods,
  the proposed one allows to account not only for the value of the variance itself
  but also for the uncertainty of the corresponding variance predictor. We prove non-asymptotic
  bounds on the risk of the resulting estimator and show the existence of several
  different convergence regimes. Theoretical analysis is illustrated with a series
  of experiments on simulated and real-world data.
