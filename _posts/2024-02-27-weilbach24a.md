abstract: Counterfactual analysis is intuitively performed by humans on a daily basis
  eg. ”What should I have done differently to get the loan approved?”. Such counterfactual
  questions also steer the formulation of scientific hypotheses. More formally it
  provides insights about potential improvements of a system by inferring the effects
  of hypothetical interventions into a past observation of the system’s behaviour
  which plays a prominent role in a variety of industrial applications. Due to the
  hypothetical nature of such analysis, counterfactual distributions are inherently
  ambiguous. This ambiguity is particularly challenging in continuous settings in
  which a continuum of explanations exist for the same observation. In this paper,
  we address this problem by following a hierarchical Bayesian approach which explicitly
  models such uncertainty. In particular, we derive counterfactual distributions for
  a Bayesian Warped Gaussian Process thereby allowing for non-Gaussian distributions
  and non-additive noise. We illustrate the properties of our approach on a synthetic
  and on a semi-synthetic example and show its performance when used within an algorithmic
  recourse downstream task.
