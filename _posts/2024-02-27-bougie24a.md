abstract: GPS coordinates are a fundamental aspect of location-based applications,
  yet prior methods for representing them do not fully capture the intricate relationships
  between different locations. In this paper, we propose a novel map-based approach
  to embedding GPS coordinates using self-supervised learning. Unlike most prior studies
  that directly embed GPS coordinates to a latent space, we leverage a map-based approach,
  allowing embeddings to capture geographical and economic features. Namely, we use
  a student-teacher architecture, where a student network is trained to mimic the
  outputs of the teacher, using two different augmented versions of the same input.
  To capture the rich underlying semantics of GPS coordinates, we further leverage
  auxiliary tasks including \textit{geo} prediction, high-level reconstruction, and
  intermediate clustering. The intermediate clustering loss facilitates learning features
  at different levels of granularity, while the high-level reconstruction loss encourages
  “local-to-global” correspondences. We evaluate our method on a large-scale dataset
  of GPS coordinates and demonstrate that it outperforms several baseline methods
  in terms of the quality of the learned embeddings. Moreover, we show the usefulness
  of our embeddings in various downstream tasks, such as predicting land price, land
  cover type, or water quality indice.
