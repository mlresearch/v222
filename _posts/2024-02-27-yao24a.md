abstract: Stroke classification is a crucial step for applications with online handwritten
  input. It is a challenging task due to the variations in writing style, complex
  structure, long contextual semantic dependence of written content and etc. In this
  work, we propose a method called Long-Range Graph U-Nets, which involves using a
  novel node and edge clustering graph pooling layer in the encoder block and a multi-level
  feature fusion strategy. Such operations guide the model to leverage both temporal
  and spatial contextual information, establish long-range semantic dependencies,
  and effectively reduce redundant information caused by local instances of the same
  category. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available online handwritten
  document datasets, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous methods
  by a significant margin, particularly in the List category, and achieves state-of-the-art
  performance.
