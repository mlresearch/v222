abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPP) play an important role in predicting or forecasting
  events. Although these problems have been studied extensively, predicting multiple
  simultaneously occurring events can be challenging. For instance, more often than
  not, a patient gets admitted to a hospital with multiple conditions at a time. Similarly
  people buy more than one stock and multiple news breaks out at the same time. Moreover,
  these events do not occur at discrete time intervals, and forecasting event sets
  in the continuous time domain remains an open problem. Na√Øve approaches for extending
  the existing TPP models for solving this problem lead to dealing with an exponentially
  large number of events or ignoring set dependencies among events. In this work,
  we propose a scalable and efficient approach based on TPPs to solve this problem.
  Our proposed approach incorporates contextual event embeddings, temporal information,
  and domain features to model the temporal event sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, showing that
  our model outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction metrics and computational
  efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the
  problem of predicting event set intensities in the continuous time domain by using
  TPPs.
