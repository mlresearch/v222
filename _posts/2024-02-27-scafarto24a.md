abstract: Unsupervised learning allows us to leverage unlabelled data, which has become
  abundantly available, and to create embeddings that are usable on a variety of downstream
  tasks. However, the typical lack of interpretability of unsupervised representation
  learning has become a limiting factor with regard to recent transparent-AI regulations.
  In this paper, we study graph representation learning and we show that data augmentation
  that preserves semantics can be learned and used to produce interpretations. Our
  framework, which we named INGENIOUS, creates inherently interpretable embeddings
  and eliminates the need for costly additional post-hoc analysis. We also introduce
  additional metrics addressing the lack of formalism and metrics in the understudied
  area of unsupervised-representation-learning interpretability. Our results are supported
  by an experimental study applied to both graph-level and node-level tasks and show
  that interpretable embeddings provide state-of-the-art performance on subsequent
  downstream tasks.
