abstract: Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths among older adults worldwide.
  Accurate fall detection can help reduce potential injuries and additional health
  complications. Different types of video modalities can be used in a home setting
  to detect falls, including RGB, Infrared, and Thermal cameras. Anomaly detection
  frameworks using autoencoders and their variants can be used for fall detection
  due to the data imbalance that arises from the rarity and diversity of falls. However,
  the use of reconstruction error in autoencoders can limit the application of networksâ€™
  structures that propagate information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective
  loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed
  frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated
  on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities.
  The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed
  by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal
  shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder,
  an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement
  was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by $0.20$ AUC ROC for a single
  camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across
  different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve
  anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection.
