abstract: 'Text detection in medical images is a critical task, essential for automating
  the extraction of valuable information from diverse healthcare documents. Conventional
  text detection methods, predominantly based on segmentation, encounter substantial
  challenges when confronted with text-rich images, extreme aspect ratios, and multi-oriented
  text. In response to these complexities, this paper introduces an innovative text
  detection system aimed at enhancing its efficacy. Our proposed system comprises
  two fundamental components: the Efficient Feature Enhancement Module (EFEM) and
  the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module (MSFM), both serving as integral elements
  of the segmentation head. The EFEM incorporates a spatial attention mechanism to
  improve segmentation performance by introducing multi-level information. The MSFM
  merges features from the EFEM at different depths and scales to generate final segmentation
  features. In conjunction with our segmentation methodology, our post-processing
  module employs a differentiable binarization technique, facilitating adaptive threshold
  adjustment to enhance text detection precision. To further bolster accuracy and
  robustness, we introduce the integration of a vision-language pre-training model.
  Through extensive pretraining on large-scale visual language understanding tasks,
  this model amasses a wealth of rich visual and semantic representations. When seamlessly
  integrated with the segmentation module, the pretraining model effectively leverages
  its potent representation capabilities. Our proposed model undergoes rigorous evaluation
  on medical text image datasets, consistently demonstrating exceptional performance.
  Benchmark experiments reaffirm its efficacy.'
