abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
  complex patterns and concepts from training data. However, recent findings indicate
  that these models tend to rely heavily on simple and easily discernible features
  present in the background of images rather than the main concepts or objects they
  are intended to classify. This phenomenon poses a challenge to image classifiers
  as the crucial elements of interest in images may be overshadowed. In this paper,
  we propose a novel approach to address this issue and improve the learning of main
  concepts by image classifiers. Our central idea revolves around concurrently guiding
  the modelâ€™s attention toward the foreground during the classification task. By emphasizing
  the foreground, which encapsulates the primary objects of interest, we aim to shift
  the focus of the model away from the dominant influence of the background. To accomplish
  this, we introduce a mechanism that encourages the model to allocate sufficient
  attention to the foreground. We investigate various strategies, including modifying
  the loss function or incorporating additional architectural components, to enable
  the classifier to effectively capture the primary concept within an image. Additionally,
  we explore the impact of different foreground attention mechanisms on model performance
  and provide insights into their effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation
  on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in improving
  the classification accuracy of image classifiers. Our findings highlight the importance
  of foreground attention in enhancing model understanding and representation of the
  main concepts within images. The results of this study contribute to advancing the
  field of image classification and provide valuable insights for developing more
  robust and accurate deep-learning models.
