abstract: Air pollution raises a detrimental impact on human health and natural environment.
  Accurate prediction of air quality is crucial for effective pollution control and
  mitigation strategies. Numerous existing methods for analyzing the variation tendency
  of a specific air component primarily focus on its temporal and spatial information,
  neglecting the potential interactions between different attributes within the same
  time interval. In this paper, we propose a Temporal-Feature correlations Attention-based
  deep learning Network (TFAN), which incorporates data fusion technology. TFAN focuses
  on capturing temporal dependencies, feature correlations, and the potential relationship
  between temporal-feature through the Attention mechanism, and the data fusion method
  allows for a comprehensive consideration of multiple factors on prediction. Experimental
  results conducted using real-world data from Beijing City demonstrate that TFAN
  outperforms various baseline models in prediction accuracy for multiple pollutants
  by 10+%.
