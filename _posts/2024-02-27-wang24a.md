abstract: 'As an essential means of copyright protection, the deep learning-based
  robust watermarking method is being studied extensively. Its framework consists
  of three main parts: the encoder, the noise layer and the decoder. But practically
  all of the schemes are directed at the encoder rather than the decoder. And the
  whole network is structured by shallow Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
  primary feature extraction, while CNNs capture local information and do not model
  non-local information in watermarked images well. To solve this problem, we consider
  the use of Transformer networks with a spatially self-attention mechanism. We propose
  to construct a novel decoder network by combining Transformer and CNNs, which can
  not only enriches local feature information but also enhances the ability to explore
  global representations. Meanwhile, to embed secret messages more perfectly, we design
  a multi-scale attentional feature fusion module to achieve an efficient aggregation
  of cover image features and secret message features, resulting in the encoded images
  with rich hybrid features. In addition, perceptual loss is introduced to better
  evaluate the visual quality of the watermarked images. Extensive experimental results
  show that our proposed method achieves better results in terms of imperceptibility
  and robustness compared with existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods.'
