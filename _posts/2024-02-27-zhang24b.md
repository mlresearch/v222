abstract: This paper introduces two key contributions aimed at improving the speed
  and quality of images generated through inverse diffusion processes. The first contribution
  involves reparameterizing the diffusion process in terms of the angle on a quarter-circular
  arc between the image and noise, specifically setting the conventional $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}}=\cos(\eta)$.
  This reparameterization eliminates two singularities and allows for the expression
  of diffusion evolution as a well-behaved ordinary differential equation (ODE). In
  turn, this allows higher order ODE solvers such as Runge-Kutta methods to be used
  effectively. The second contribution is to directly estimate both the image ($\mathbf{x}_0$)
  and noise ($\mathbf{\epsilon}$) using our network, which enables more stable calculations
  of the update step in the inverse diffusion steps, as accurate estimation of both
  the image and noise are crucial at different stages of the process. Together with
  these changes, our model achieves faster generation, with the ability to converge
  on high-quality images more quickly, and higher quality of the generated images,
  as measured by metrics such as Fr{é}chet Inception Distance (FID), spatial Fr{é}chet
  Inception Distance (sFID), precision, and recall.
