abstract: The cold-start problem poses a significant challenge in recommendation systems,
  particularly when interaction data is scarce. While meta-learning has shown promise
  in few-shot classification, its application to cold-start recommendations has mostly
  involved simple transplantations of generic approaches. The effectiveness of metric
  learning, a powerful meta-learning method, is hindered by differences in problem
  definition when applied to rating prediction. Heterogeneous information networks
  (HINs), as high-order graph structures, can capture valuable semantic information
  even in data-starved conditions. Efficient utilization of HINs can alleviate the
  cold-start dilemma. However, in the cold-start domain, there is a lack of dynamic
  node-level and semantic-level feature fusion schemes, resulting in the underutilization
  of complex information. This study addresses these issues by combining metric learning
  and HINs, proposing OMHIN (Dynamic Offset Metric approach to Heterogeneous Information
  Networks). Our approach transforms a direct similarity metric into an indirect metric
  to enhance model robustness. By flexibly applying one-dimensional convolution, OMHIN
  effectively integrates rich information from HINs while minimizing noise introduction.
  Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that OMHIN achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in various scenarios, particularly in complex and challenging situations.
  It is especially suitable for sequence cold-start recommendations.
