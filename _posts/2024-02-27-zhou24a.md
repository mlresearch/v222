abstract: 'Sequential maximization of expected improvement (EI) is one of the most
  widely used policies in Bayesian optimization because of its simplicity and ability
  to handle noisy observations. In particular, the improvement function often uses
  the best posterior mean as the best incumbent in noisy settings. However, the uncertainty
  associated with the incumbent solution is often neglected in many analytic EI-type
  methods: a closed-form acquisition function is derived in the noise-free setting,
  but then applied to the setting with noisy observations. To address this limitation,
  we propose a modification of EI that corrects its closed-form expression by incorporating
  the covariance information provided by the Gaussian Process (GP) model. This acquisition
  function specializes to the classical noise-free result, and we argue should replace
  that formula in Bayesian optimization software packages, tutorials, and textbooks.
  This enhanced acquisition provides good generality for noisy and noiseless settings.
  We show that our method achieves a sublinear convergence rate on the cumulative
  regret bound under heteroscedastic observation noise. Our empirical results demonstrate
  that our proposed acquisition function can outperform EI in the presence of noisy
  observations on benchmark functions for black-box optimization, as well as on parameter
  search for neural network model compression.'
